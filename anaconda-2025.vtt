22:17.003 --> 22:20.256
Horrible grandmother. But still sad.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.507
[Kenny] Huh.

22:21.591 --> 22:22.759
I'm sorry, who are you?

22:23.426 --> 22:26.429
Oh, I'm sorry. Carlos Santiago.
Yeah, you can call me Santiago.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.514
- Hey! It's Kenny.
- [Santiago] Yeah, hey.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.142
- Kenny from the phone. Hey.
- Kenny. Kenny, hey.

22:31.225 --> 22:33.311
- Hi.
- Yeah, this is our snake handler.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.312
[Claire, Doug] Oh!

22:34.395 --> 22:36.147
- [Claire] Thank God.
- He's supposed to be the best.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.316
No. "Supposed to be"?
We have a joker here.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.985
No. I am the best. Yes.

22:41.069 --> 22:42.070
- Oh. That's good.
- [Kenny] Yeah.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.238
So, welcome to Brazil.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.699
Let's meet the snake.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.785
[people chattering indistinctly]

22:48.868 --> 22:50.870
[tense music playing]

22:59.170 --> 23:01.631
[in Portuguese]
Go around, we'll find her.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.387
[patrons speaking Portuguese]

23:20.274 --> 23:23.152
[in English] When I found him,
he was dying of starvation.

23:23.945 --> 23:28.241
His food supply destroyed by gold miners
who put mercury in the river.

23:28.324 --> 23:31.160
- [Griff] Gold miners?
- Gold mining poisons our land.

23:31.953 --> 23:34.831
Their greed almost killed my snake.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.415
- [Claire] Oh.
- [Santiago] But I fed him,

23:36.499 --> 23:39.127
I nursed him back to life,

23:39.210 --> 23:42.755
and in many ways, he did the same for me.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.466
Ah, yes. A tale as old as time.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.426
Saved by a snake. [chuckles]

23:49.804 --> 23:51.139
What's your name?

23:51.222 --> 23:52.223
What's... Uh, Griff.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.475
Okay, Griff. He's not only a snake.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.353
He's my tiny giant, my friend.

23:58.271 --> 24:02.066
One of the most important creatures
of the herpetological world.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.235
No, of course... I... Sure.

24:04.318 --> 24:07.071
I didn't... I wasn't trying to...
I... Yes.

24:07.155 --> 24:10.241
Okay. Let me introduce you.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.661
[trunk opens]

24:13.744 --> 24:14.996
Heitor.

24:15.079 --> 24:17.874
- [Claire] Heitor?
- Oh, my goodness.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.542
Hey, cutie.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.003
- Oh, no. Not cutie.
- Oh, my...

24:22.086 --> 24:23.546
- [Doug] Oh...
- [all exclaim]

24:23.629 --> 24:26.340
Oh, hell yes! This thing is nuts!

24:26.424 --> 24:29.886
There are rumors of 'condas even bigger.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.513
Maybe four or five times this size.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.266
Go ahead, Kenny from the phone.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.644
Um, is it true that
they regurgitate their prey?

24:38.728 --> 24:40.354
Um, sometimes.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.315
I mean, if you're lucky,

24:42.398 --> 24:45.401
you'd die right away because of...
[groans] ...suffocation.

24:46.027 --> 24:50.031
But only the unlucky ones survive.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.324
Unlucky?

24:52.992 --> 24:57.371
Yeah, because then
you might actually be conscious

24:57.455 --> 25:01.250
when the snake comes back
to finish you off.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.377
- [Doug] Gotcha.
- [Claire] Ooh.

25:03.461 --> 25:04.754
Better to die.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.590
[tense music playing]

25:14.013 --> 25:16.724
- [Kenny] Look at that boat!
- [Doug] This is money in the bank, baby.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.899
[keys jingle]

25:31.239 --> 25:33.115
- [music stops]
- [patrons chattering]

25:34.116 --> 25:35.952
[tense music playing]

25:36.744 --> 25:38.204
[thuds]

25:42.458 --> 25:44.377
Hey. Let me ask you a question.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.754
- Um, our snake guy...
- Mmm?

25:47.255 --> 25:49.924
Does he seem kind of batshit crazy?

25:50.007 --> 25:52.468
I mean, he's best friends with a snake.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.928
- Of course he's a little quirky.
- Yeah.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.012
But I like him.

25:55.096 --> 25:55.930
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.014
But then again,

25:57.098 --> 25:59.141
I used up all my vacation days

25:59.225 --> 26:02.436
to come make a self-financed snake movie
with you three, so...

26:02.520 --> 26:04.647
- Yeah, your judgment is really off.
- My judgment is off.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.773
- It always has been.
- Exactly.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.817
[Doug] Anybody talk to the captain?
It's time to shoot.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.986
I'll, uh, reach out again, boss.

26:10.069 --> 26:10.903
- [Doug exclaims]
- [chuckles]

26:10.987 --> 26:13.072
Hi, guys. My name is Ana.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.991
I believe you spoke
to my father on the phone?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.159
Bruno? That's your dad?

26:17.868 --> 26:19.078
Yeah, he sends his apologies,

26:19.161 --> 26:21.330
- but he's at the hospital.
- Oh.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.707
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- [Ana] Unfortunately,

26:22.790 --> 26:24.625
you'll have to make other accommodations,

26:24.709 --> 26:27.837
'cause I need to take this boat upriver
for a routine service.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.380
But I can assure you a full refund.

26:29.463 --> 26:30.423
No, wait. Wait.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.425
- Everything else is booked.
- [Griff] Yeah.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.302
And-- And w-we're gonna shoot a movie.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.012
It's a reboot of <i>Anaconda</i>.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.014
Technically,
it's more of a reimagining, but--

26:38.097 --> 26:39.974
It's actually more of a spiritual sequel.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.142
Good for you.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.185
- There's gotta be a way, right?
- We can crew the boat.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.270
There's nothing I can do...

26:44.353 --> 26:47.732
We have dreamed of making
this film together our entire lives.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.192
Please. I am begging you.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.236
- Please.
- Help us find another way.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.030
- Let's do this, but fast.
- [Doug] Okay.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.531
- [Claire] Yes! Let's go!
- Thank you!

26:57.241 --> 26:59.618
[upbeat music playing]

27:04.081 --> 27:06.375
[clanking, whirring]

27:16.427 --> 27:17.720
[Griff] Whoo!

27:17.803 --> 27:19.680
- Oh!
- [Griff] Wow!

27:19.764 --> 27:20.765
Yes!

27:20.848 --> 27:22.767
This is so beautiful.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.769
This is amazing. It's amazing.

27:26.812 --> 27:27.855
- Looks exactly...
- [Doug laughs]

27:27.938 --> 27:28.939
Ooh, look!

27:30.649 --> 27:31.942
- Kenny?
- [Kenny] Yeah, bud?

27:32.026 --> 27:34.028
- How did you find this boat?
- Cocktail, anyone?

27:34.111 --> 27:35.988
- [Griff] Nice!
- [Doug] Ah!

27:36.072 --> 27:37.073
[Kenny] It's a computer.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.576
Yes!

27:43.746 --> 27:45.790
[in Portuguese]
I want a list of all the boats

27:45.873 --> 27:47.958
that left the marina in the last 3 hours.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.127
Now!

27:50.961 --> 27:52.421
[drawer opens]

27:55.674 --> 27:57.051
[guitar playing]

27:57.551 --> 27:59.095
- [all laughing]
- [glass clinking]

27:59.178 --> 28:00.179
- [Griff] Uh-oh.
- [Claire] Oh.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.390
[Doug] One more thing, you guys,
before we go to bed.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.183
We got a big day tomorrow.

28:04.266 --> 28:08.312
If you remember,
we had a tradition on all our films.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.189
The night before we started shooting,

28:10.272 --> 28:12.817
- we'd say a prayer to the movie gods...
- [Griff] Mm-hmm.

28:12.900 --> 28:16.028
...asking them to basically
not screw us over,

28:16.112 --> 28:19.323
and for the first time ever,
may they listen.

28:19.407 --> 28:20.991
- Come on, to the movie gods.
- Yes.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.076
[glasses clinking]

28:22.159 --> 28:23.160
[Doug chuckles]

28:23.244 --> 28:24.495
[all chattering indistinctly]

28:24.578 --> 28:26.580
[epic music playing]

28:37.174 --> 28:38.384
[Kenny] All right. We're rolling.

28:38.467 --> 28:41.262
<i>Anaconda,</i> scene 15, take one. Slap it.

28:41.345 --> 28:42.847
Bella!

28:44.014 --> 28:47.101
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- I've come to take you home.

28:47.184 --> 28:50.146
It's time you stopped chasing
this mythical snake.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.190
And what if I'm not prone to giving up?

28:53.691 --> 28:54.942
I didn't see you filming there.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.819
What are we doing? EPK?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.904
Background, DVD, bonus stuff.

28:58.988 --> 29:02.741
<i>The Anaconda </i>is a story
of an intrepid biologist played by Claire,

29:02.825 --> 29:08.372
<i>who hires an unhinged snake tracker</i>
<i>played by Griff,</i>

29:08.456 --> 29:11.167
to hunt down and kill
a giant, mythical 'conda

29:11.250 --> 29:12.501
that ate her entire family.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.463
Come and get me, you goddamn snake!

29:15.546 --> 29:17.715
And on a deeper level,
it's about chasing your dreams.

29:17.798 --> 29:23.179
And camera set, push-ups good, and action!

29:23.262 --> 29:24.597
What's it like shooting with Doug again?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.182
He and I are best friends.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.600
<i>We've worked together our whole lives.</i>

29:27.683 --> 29:29.518
<i>And I went out to LA,</i>
<i>and he was gonna come out.</i>

29:29.602 --> 29:32.271
We were gonna be a partnership,
and he didn't do it.

29:32.354 --> 29:36.609
Griff and I planned to work together
in LA, but, uh, you know, life intervened.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.277
But it doesn't matter,
'cause now we're together

29:38.360 --> 29:41.405
and now we're back, we're making this,
and it's as it should be.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.199
I am the insects.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.158
[Claire shrieks]

29:44.241 --> 29:46.911
The anaconda moves slow and steady.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.078
Sometimes it goes fast.

29:48.162 --> 29:50.706
Snake POV, RD. Take 1.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.250
No. No, it's not working.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.920
Snake POV, the right way. Take 2.

29:56.754 --> 29:59.465
Sometimes he goes from above in the trees,

29:59.548 --> 30:01.592
sometimes from below in the water.

30:01.675 --> 30:05.804
The toothpick, it unlocked a couple
of aspects of this character for me.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.014
There's something there.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.643
Ah!

30:10.726 --> 30:13.103
Why would I be nervous
about doing a love story with Griff?

30:13.187 --> 30:14.355
You guys used to date.

30:14.897 --> 30:16.232
That was a long time ago.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.483
A little bit of chaos

30:17.566 --> 30:19.193
<i>is part of the ingredients.</i>

30:19.944 --> 30:21.111
[grunts, groans]

30:25.741 --> 30:26.659
[shrieks]

30:26.742 --> 30:27.910
[Doug] <i>Maybe look at each other.</i>

30:27.993 --> 30:29.995
This might be the last time
you look at each other.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.039
You'd think you'd be
a little nicer to the guy

30:32.122 --> 30:33.916
who's out here to save your life.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.251
You're an asshole.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.835
[laughs]

30:37.461 --> 30:38.462
Yeah.

30:39.296 --> 30:41.131
And a PhD.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.886
And cut.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.847
- Great stuff, guys. We got it.
- Whoo-hoo!

30:48.931 --> 30:51.767
Should we go one more time?
You wanna try it again?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.435
No. I'm good if you're good.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.853
Let's go one more time.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.150
[animals chirping in distance]

31:00.234 --> 31:02.236
[gentle music playing]

31:02.820 --> 31:06.699
- The chemistry between you two is...
- Yeah?

31:06.782 --> 31:08.993
- Like we were right back in high school.
- [chuckles]

31:09.076 --> 31:10.411
When you looked up at her...

31:10.494 --> 31:11.745
Well, that's 'cause of your note.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.956
About taking the beat
right before you did it?

31:14.039 --> 31:15.916
Yeah, yeah. It made the scene.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.751
I tell you... [sighs]

31:18.252 --> 31:20.588
[stutters] I never felt like this
on <i>S.W.A.T.</i>

31:20.671 --> 31:22.881
I mean, granted
I was only in a couple of episodes,

31:22.965 --> 31:24.925
but it was never collaborative.
It was never fun.

31:25.009 --> 31:26.093
Not... [scoffs]

31:26.176 --> 31:27.761
Not like this. This, uh...

31:27.845 --> 31:30.347
- This is--
- Like we were back on <i>Quatch</i>?

31:32.224 --> 31:33.892
Yeah. [chuckles]

31:34.768 --> 31:35.769
Yeah.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.777
[Doug] Do you guys have chupacabra?

31:44.528 --> 31:46.864
[Claire] Ooh. That looks so good.

31:47.698 --> 31:48.741
Mm-mmm.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.368
Hey, so, one script thing.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.912
I was thinking, at the midway point,

31:53.996 --> 31:57.833
instead of, uh,
talking the bad guy out of it,

31:57.916 --> 31:59.376
what if...

31:59.460 --> 32:01.211
Claire's character...

32:02.379 --> 32:03.631
headbutts him?

32:03.714 --> 32:05.716
Sorry. Headbutts him?

32:06.383 --> 32:07.426
Headbutts him.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.511
Or... Or...

32:10.804 --> 32:11.805
we both do.

32:11.889 --> 32:13.307
- Double headbutt.
- [Claire scoffs]

32:13.390 --> 32:15.559
- Come on. It's kinda revolutionary.
- [Kenny] Double headbutt.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.061
That is super revolutionary.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.104
Why is that super revolutionary?

32:19.188 --> 32:21.273
Well, it's... [stutters]
...never been done.

32:21.357 --> 32:24.652
Jesus Christ. This is a beautiful scene
with real stakes, Doug.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.195
Feel free to weigh in here.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.655
Nah, I hear you. I do.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.324
And, as always,
I trust your instincts on this.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.370
But a double headbutt
is pretty revolutionary.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.373
Right? It is--
It's very revolutionary. Yes.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.291
- There's no denying it.
- [Kenny] None!

32:39.375 --> 32:42.419
Oh, come on, Claire. Is the problem that
you don't know how to headbutt?

32:42.503 --> 32:44.797
Why would I not know how to headbutt?

32:44.880 --> 32:47.049
[Griff] We're not born with these skills.
We learn them along the way.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.469
Let me show you.
Tight core, breathe in, hold that breath.

32:50.552 --> 32:51.845
- [Claire] Yeah?
- Hi-yah!

32:51.929 --> 32:53.389
- [Griff] And you can vocalize.
- Wow.

32:54.098 --> 32:58.644
Another kind of headbutt
is more unleashed, just full-on...

32:58.727 --> 33:00.145
[exclaims] Whoo!

33:00.229 --> 33:01.814
He got the arms in there. That's good.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.440
Send that shit into the goal.

33:03.524 --> 33:06.568
Or you put some Brazilian sauce on that.
You know?

33:06.652 --> 33:08.737
- And you go, boom! <i>Toma</i>!
- [Doug] Oh!

33:08.821 --> 33:10.197
- [Santiago] <i>Toma</i>!
- <i>Toma</i>?

33:10.280 --> 33:11.407
Hey, I love it.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.700
Yeah, that's right.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.952
- Brazilian spice.
- Yeah!

33:15.035 --> 33:17.996
If I was gonna headbutt,
I would go for the bridge of the nose.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.207
- Yes.
- Just crack it. Hi-yah!

33:20.290 --> 33:23.043
- Jesus!
- Yes! That's it.

33:25.087 --> 33:27.464
- [Kenny] Jeez. Yeah, that's great.
- And you go, <i>"Toma! Toma!"</i>

33:27.548 --> 33:28.382
[exclaims]

33:28.465 --> 33:31.385

34:27.357 --> 34:30.152
I'm sorry, but how could this happen, huh?

34:30.235 --> 34:32.029
Kenny, I thought you said
this guy was a pro.

34:32.112 --> 34:35.532
That's what he said, but he hasn't
provided us with a certificate.

34:35.616 --> 34:37.785
You fixed the crate, right?
It's taken care of?

34:37.868 --> 34:41.538
My thing. My job. Under control. All good.

34:42.414 --> 34:46.585
My Heitor, he's a beautiful, intelligent,
smart, sexy creature.

34:47.503 --> 34:49.671
He does exactly what I command.

34:50.464 --> 34:53.550
And I would never let anything happen

34:53.634 --> 34:58.305
to you or the crazy one,
or her, or her, or this "actor" here.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.766
- What the...
- So have a good night.

35:02.643 --> 35:07.773

35:27.584 --> 35:29.920
Okay. Actors, on your marks.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.214
Santiago, is Heitor ready?

35:32.297 --> 35:33.966
Yes, Heitor is always ready.

35:34.049 --> 35:36.426
Heitor is ready, and action!

35:41.223 --> 35:42.516
[whimpers] Cut, please.

35:43.767 --> 35:46.895
- Um, cut? All right, cut. Yeah.
- Yeah, I just-- Sorry. I need a little...

35:46.979 --> 35:48.355
Kenny, do you mind if I...

35:48.438 --> 35:50.649
Santiago, take five. Heitor, five.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.318
- Hey. Wow, that thing, it's really...
- Hey.

35:53.402 --> 35:56.363
It's huge when you see it
up close and personal like that.

35:56.446 --> 35:57.656
Majestic creature.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.741
But I just was wondering...

35:59.825 --> 36:04.496
I throw myself in front of the snake
to kind of protect Claire's character,

36:04.580 --> 36:05.747
- right?
- Correct.

36:05.831 --> 36:09.668
Is there any value in not doing that?

36:10.168 --> 36:11.378
What? No.

36:11.461 --> 36:14.423
- No, no, he sacrifices himself for her.
- Yeah. Of course.

36:14.464 --> 36:16.800
- It caps his arc. It's so important.
- Right. Right.

36:16.884 --> 36:20.012
- And also, dude, it's totally safe.
- Yeah.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.848
- Santiago has Heitor under control.
- Okay.

36:22.931 --> 36:26.018
- You've got nothing to worry about.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah...

36:26.101 --> 36:28.061
- We're good. You're good.
- Yeah. Okay.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.855
- Okay.
- All right, let's do this.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.315
All right, take it from the top.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.109
Back to one.

36:35.277 --> 36:38.405
Santiago, Heitor? Action!

36:39.489 --> 36:40.490
Go!

36:41.491 --> 36:44.411
I'm not leaving! Not without you, Derek.

36:44.494 --> 36:47.539
This thing's got me.
The world's depending on you.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.583
I'm depending on you.

36:52.419 --> 36:55.255
It's just-- I can't-- [groans]

36:55.339 --> 36:58.383
- Put your face right up next to the snake.
- I don't like this.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.719
- I don't want to do it anymore.
- [Doug] Get a tiny bit closer.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.554
Get closer. He's friendly.

37:02.638 --> 37:05.390
- I think you got it, dude!
- No, I don't quite have it!

37:05.474 --> 37:07.935
- Doug, you got the shot! You got the shot!
- Hold it! Just a couple more beats.

37:08.018 --> 37:10.270
This is gold.
Just give me one more second.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.481

46:34.501 --> 46:35.710
Like, that way.

46:36.252 --> 46:38.796
Wait. Kenny, are you high right now?

46:38.880 --> 46:40.924
Yeah, but I'm good. I already peaked.

46:41.007 --> 46:42.300
Jesus Christ, Kenny.

46:42.383 --> 46:43.885
We're completely lost.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.806
Wait. You guys, this way.

46:49.390 --> 46:51.184
It looks like an old camper van.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.687
[tense music playing]

47:06.032 --> 47:07.033
[sighs]

47:07.825 --> 47:08.660
[walkie-talkie bleeps]

47:08.743 --> 47:10.203
[in Portuguese] Ana is not on the boat.

47:10.286 --> 47:13.748
I need you to search the area.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.167
The men are scared to
go deeper into the jungle.

47:16.251 --> 47:18.545
<i>I don't care, we have to find her.</i>

47:23.633 --> 47:24.634
[Griff] What is that?

47:24.717 --> 47:27.470
[Kenny chuckles] Oh,
maybe Santiago's sleeping in there.

47:27.554 --> 47:28.513
[Doug] <i>Hola.</i>

47:28.596 --> 47:29.931
[animals chittering]

47:31.224 --> 47:32.267
[Doug] Whoa.

47:33.309 --> 47:36.271
Looks totally abandoned. Anybody home?

47:37.188 --> 47:38.189
[Claire sighs]

47:42.402 --> 47:43.945
Maybe some food and water.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.405
Yeah. We could stay here.

47:45.488 --> 47:46.614
At least tonight.

47:51.703 --> 47:55.123
Oh, man, there's gotta be snacks in here.

47:56.416 --> 47:57.458
[rustling nearby]

47:57.959 --> 47:58.960
[shushes]

48:02.672 --> 48:04.716
[rustling]

48:04.799 --> 48:06.801
[tense music playing]

48:10.513 --> 48:12.056
[Ana breathes shakily]

48:18.229 --> 48:20.231
[all breathing shakily]

48:23.151 --> 48:23.985
[all scream]

48:24.068 --> 48:25.236
Oh, my God.

48:25.320 --> 48:26.362
- [Kenny] Oh, God.
- [Doug] Santiago!

48:26.446 --> 48:27.614
[Claire] Oh, God.

48:27.697 --> 48:29.324
- [Doug gasps]
- [Kenny] Dang!

48:30.325 --> 48:31.909
That's where that guy went!

48:31.993 --> 48:33.828
Oh, my God. What is out there?

48:33.911 --> 48:35.830
[tense music playing]

48:35.913 --> 48:36.914
[growling]

48:43.463 --> 48:44.839
[Claire breathes shakily]

48:44.922 --> 48:46.799
- [Ana] We gotta go now!
- Okay. Go, go, go.

48:46.883 --> 48:48.718
- Let's get out of here.
- [Ana] Let's go, let's go.

48:48.801 --> 48:50.887
- We can't let it crush the van.
- Crush the van?

48:50.970 --> 48:51.888
- It's not working.
- [engine sputtering]

48:51.971 --> 48:52.805
What?

48:52.889 --> 48:53.723
- It's not--
- Damn it!

48:53.806 --> 48:55.475
- It's a camper van, probably!
- Oh, God!

48:55.558 --> 48:57.685
It's got a split-- [stutters]
a split-charge battery.

48:57.769 --> 49:00.146
The relay probably popped off.
It's underneath the hood.

49:00.229 --> 49:01.564
Kenny, can you fix it?

49:01.648 --> 49:03.941
Usually I could fix it, yes,
but I'm having--

49:04.025 --> 49:07.153
I'm still having some visual problems
because of the... [chuckles]

49:07.236 --> 49:08.655
You did it to me again.

49:08.738 --> 49:13.368
You did it on the wedding video
and now you're wasted off your ass again.

49:13.451 --> 49:14.869
I'm really sorry, boss.

49:14.952 --> 49:18.665
[groans] Buffalo sober.
You're Buffalo sober.

49:18.748 --> 49:19.749
Do you have any more?

49:19.832 --> 49:21.959
Griff, please can you fix it?

49:22.043 --> 49:23.961
I think I'm better suited
to be our wheel man.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.089
What are you talking about?
I've always been a better driver than you.

49:26.172 --> 49:27.131
No, you've been a safer driver.

49:27.215 --> 49:29.300
I passed the driver's test
on my first try.

49:29.384 --> 49:30.718
You took three times.

49:30.802 --> 49:32.220
Yeah, but that was 'cause of yield.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.013
I didn't know-- Now I know what that is.

49:34.097 --> 49:36.307
Oh, my God. We're gonna die.

49:36.391 --> 49:37.642
[breathes heavily]

49:38.476 --> 49:39.519
Sorry.

49:41.312 --> 49:42.313
I'll just fix it.

49:42.397 --> 49:44.399
[tense music playing]

49:57.704 --> 49:59.664
[breathes shakily]

50:08.464 --> 50:09.465
[hood clicks open]

50:10.633 --> 50:11.801
[hood creaking]

50:18.224 --> 50:19.225
[creaks]

50:20.935 --> 50:22.395
[breathes shakily]

50:33.406 --> 50:35.158
[tense music playing]

50:50.298 --> 50:51.591
[hood thuds, clatters]

50:52.759 --> 50:53.801
[Claire breathes shakily]

50:54.302 --> 50:56.262
- [engine starts]
- [growling]

50:58.139 --> 50:58.973
[screams]

50:59.056 --> 51:00.433
- Doug!
- Go, go, go!

51:01.225 --> 51:02.810
Let me get up. Hey, wait! Stop! Stop!

51:03.311 --> 51:05.646
Griff, where are you going?
Don't leave without me!

51:05.730 --> 51:06.731
[grunts]

51:08.816 --> 51:09.984
Oh, shit!

51:11.068 --> 51:12.737
[groans, cries]

51:12.820 --> 51:13.946
[Griff] You saw it, right?

51:14.030 --> 51:15.698
What was that? They're not
supposed to get that big.

51:15.782 --> 51:18.534
Oh, God. It was like a dinosaur. [screams]

51:20.953 --> 51:22.163
[engines revving]

51:22.914 --> 51:23.915
Hey!

51:26.751 --> 51:28.628
Hey, maybe we can ask these guys for help.

51:28.711 --> 51:29.545
- Hey!
- Hey!

51:29.629 --> 51:31.881
- We have to stop.
- Do not stop the car.

51:31.964 --> 51:33.257
Ana, what is going on?

51:33.341 --> 51:36.219
They're illegal gold miners
who patrol the jungles around here.

51:36.302 --> 51:37.678
These guys are dangerous.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.598
They'll kill anyone
who crosses into their territory.

51:40.681 --> 51:42.892
- Oh, shit. They're trying to kill us.
- [Griff] Fuck!

51:43.684 --> 51:45.228
[Doug] Why are they shooting at us?

51:45.311 --> 51:46.979
- [gunshot]
- [Griff exclaims]

51:47.063 --> 51:48.731
[Claire] Griff,
can't you drive any faster?

51:50.358 --> 51:51.567
Whoa!

51:51.651 --> 51:53.402
Whoa, whoa. Ana, what are you doing?

51:53.486 --> 51:54.320
[Ana grunts]

51:54.403 --> 51:55.446
Whoa!

51:55.530 --> 51:56.823
[Ana grunting]

51:57.406 --> 51:59.909
- [Doug] Kenny, are you getting this?
- [Kenny] Yes!

52:01.244 --> 52:02.578
Keep rolling!

52:04.497 --> 52:05.623
[Ana groans]

52:05.706 --> 52:07.959
Griff, faster.

52:09.335 --> 52:10.336
[exclaims]

52:11.212 --> 52:12.547
Only one left.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.298
[groaning]

52:15.132 --> 52:16.342
[tires squeal]

52:18.052 --> 52:19.303
[door slides open]

52:27.812 --> 52:29.522
[breathing heavily]

52:36.195 --> 52:38.155
- Where is she?
- [gasps] Oh, my God.

52:38.239 --> 52:39.282
Where is she?

52:42.368 --> 52:44.203
Who? Who do... Who do you mean?

52:44.287 --> 52:45.788
I know there's someone else here.

52:45.872 --> 52:47.999
So, where is she--

52:48.082 --> 52:49.125
[Ana exclaims]

52:53.462 --> 52:54.463
Let's go, come on.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.090
We gotta go. Fast.

52:56.173 --> 52:58.092
[Claire breathing heavily]

52:58.175 --> 53:00.094
Look, I can get you guys out of here.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.305
All we need to do is keep heading north.

53:02.805 --> 53:06.017
There's a small airport
about a day and a half from here.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.810
You can get us home?

53:07.894 --> 53:09.520
- [Ana] Yes.
- Get us home.

53:09.604 --> 53:10.897
I think we gotta call it.

53:11.480 --> 53:14.233
Man, we've got such good stuff,
and we're so close.

53:14.734 --> 53:17.778
Really? We're going home?

53:17.862 --> 53:18.863
[Doug] Buddy, I know.

53:18.946 --> 53:21.449
I don't wanna go home empty-handed either.

53:21.532 --> 53:24.243
But we came out here to make <i>Anaconda</i>,

53:24.744 --> 53:25.953
and now we're in it.

53:26.454 --> 53:27.496
[mumbles]

53:27.997 --> 53:29.415
[tapping on table]

53:29.498 --> 53:30.541
Yeah.

53:34.337 --> 53:35.463
I'm sorry.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.303
[sighs]

53:47.642 --> 53:48.643
[kisses]

53:49.435 --> 53:50.519
[exhales deeply]

53:50.603 --> 53:52.605
[epic music playing]

54:12.708 --> 54:13.876
[exhales deeply]

54:14.669 --> 54:17.838
Guys, emergency meeting.

54:17.922 --> 54:19.840
Cast and crew only. Kenny, sit down.

54:19.924 --> 54:21.676
- [Kenny] What is that?
- New pages.

54:21.759 --> 54:23.469
We have some time before the next port

54:23.552 --> 54:27.848
and I had an idea last night that I think
is just too damn good not to shoot.

54:27.932 --> 54:30.643
Doug, everybody's pretty burnt, man.

54:30.726 --> 54:32.895
Just hear me out.
I'm begging you please, Kenny.

54:32.979 --> 54:34.981
- All right. Sorry, boss.
- [Doug] Thank you.

54:35.064 --> 54:37.942
What if you two, on your way
to find the anaconda,

54:38.025 --> 54:41.070
ran into a total badass
on an incredible quest?

54:41.153 --> 54:43.322
Oh. That's interesting.

54:43.406 --> 54:46.826
Let me guess,
to expose illegal gold miners?

54:46.909 --> 54:47.743
Bingo.

54:47.827 --> 54:49.870
- Raises the stakes.
- [Doug] Exactly.

54:49.954 --> 54:51.872
And while they're hunting down
this mythical snake,

54:51.956 --> 54:54.041
they actually end up
fighting the real villain.

54:54.625 --> 54:55.626
An even bigger snake.

54:55.710 --> 54:58.170
- Man.
- Oh, yeah. Yes.

54:58.254 --> 54:59.463
Man.

54:59.547 --> 55:00.965
I like this.

55:01.590 --> 55:02.508
This is good.

55:02.591 --> 55:05.761
And if we add this element,
it does make the movie much bigger.

55:06.262 --> 55:08.723
Like, now, it's about something.

55:10.850 --> 55:11.767
Themes.

55:12.393 --> 55:14.311
Themes. [chuckles]

55:15.271 --> 55:16.355
Uh...

55:19.775 --> 55:20.860
Uh-huh.

55:20.943 --> 55:22.153
Yeah.

55:22.236 --> 55:24.030
Okay, guy-- You know what, guys?

55:24.113 --> 55:26.699
[stammering] I didn't wanna say
anything before, but...

55:28.868 --> 55:30.578
this thing might be an Awards play.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.329
[Claire gasps]

55:32.413 --> 55:35.291
I mean, the Academy loves social horror.

55:35.374 --> 55:36.459
- Right?
- [Griff] Yeah.

55:37.877 --> 55:41.505
Dude, you could be the white Jordan Peele.

55:42.048 --> 55:44.258
[sighs] I was thinking the same thing.

55:47.595 --> 55:49.305
We've been through so much, you guys.

55:49.930 --> 55:51.640
Let's finish this movie.

55:53.934 --> 55:55.269
I'm in.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.520
- Let's do it.
- [Griff] Yeah.

55:56.604 --> 56:01.984
Oh... Who are you gonna get to play
this new, awesome character?

56:04.320 --> 56:05.821
[exclaims in Portuguese]

56:05.905 --> 56:07.531
[Kenny] Ow! [groaning]

56:08.074 --> 56:09.158
[speaking Portuguese]

56:09.241 --> 56:11.202
And cut. Yes!

56:11.285 --> 56:12.745
- [Ana] Was it good?
- That's what I'm talking about.

56:12.828 --> 56:13.662
- [Claire] Nice.
- [Kenny] Yeah.

56:13.746 --> 56:16.040
- You sure you've never acted before?
- I swear.

56:16.123 --> 56:17.917
Some of the best acting I've ever seen.

56:18.542 --> 56:21.045
- You're a natural. You're incredible.
- [Ana] Thank you.

56:21.128 --> 56:22.797
Take five. Next up, we got 72.

56:23.631 --> 56:27.009
- Guys, you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

56:27.093 --> 56:28.677
- She's incredible, right?
- Yeah.

56:28.761 --> 56:30.846
Hey... [stammers] ...a question, though.

56:30.930 --> 56:35.142
If-- If she saves us, it doesn't really
give my character anything to do.

56:35.226 --> 56:36.268
Yeah.

56:36.352 --> 56:40.397
This was supposed to be the moment where
my character starts falling for Derek,

56:40.481 --> 56:44.401
so he needs to do
something heroic, you know? Unselfish.

56:44.485 --> 56:47.029
I don't know, you guys,
this just feels like her moment,

56:47.113 --> 56:49.198
she actually did it in real life.

56:49.740 --> 56:52.284
But good news, I'm gonna shoot
all the rest on her

56:52.368 --> 56:54.120
so you guys have the day off.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.038
See you later.

56:57.123 --> 56:58.624
Take the day off.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.210
Huh.

57:01.293 --> 57:03.254
[gentle music playing]

57:07.049 --> 57:10.678
[Claire] This is our movie, Griff,
and he's just cutting us out.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.596
[Griff] Yep.
Welcome to show business, baby.

57:12.680 --> 57:15.891
You're not in it unless you're getting
screwed over by your friends.

57:15.975 --> 57:16.976
[chuckles]

57:17.476 --> 57:18.561
Yeah.

57:20.479 --> 57:24.108
You ever wake up and wonder
what the hell have I done with my life?

57:24.692 --> 57:27.486
- [chuckling] Oh, yeah. Like, every day.
- Mmm.

57:27.570 --> 57:30.072
Hey, at least you had the guts
to go after what you wanted.

57:30.156 --> 57:32.032
- No.
- You think I wanted to go to law school?

57:32.533 --> 57:34.326
What have I got to show
for it though, huh?

57:34.410 --> 57:35.411
You know what I have?

57:35.494 --> 57:39.373
I have a terrible apartment
and a 74-year-old roommate.

57:40.332 --> 57:44.461
[sighs] Sometimes I go to Trader Joe's
just to feel air conditioning.

57:46.088 --> 57:47.548
You at least have a career.

57:49.049 --> 57:51.051
I mean, what do I have to show for it?

57:52.261 --> 57:55.264
I've got no family. No career.

57:56.182 --> 57:58.017
Never done anything that matters.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.560
No nothing.

58:00.269 --> 58:01.270
[sighs]

58:01.979 --> 58:03.189
It's never too late.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.406
[knocking on door]

58:12.489 --> 58:14.074
[Doug] <i>Griff, I know you're in there.</i>

58:14.158 --> 58:15.451
<i>Let's make a movie.</i>

58:16.785 --> 58:17.995
[Griff groans]

58:18.787 --> 58:19.872
Ugh.

58:19.955 --> 58:20.956
<i>Hola, amigo.</i>

58:21.040 --> 58:23.876
Jesus. Come on, get dressed.
We've got a packed day.

58:23.959 --> 58:25.461
What are you talking about?
I am dressed.

58:25.544 --> 58:27.588
I'm dressed really...
very nicely.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.548
All right. Can you just
take a cold shower?

58:29.632 --> 58:30.966
We gotta film, like, now.

58:31.050 --> 58:33.052
Here's an idea. You know what
you should call the movie?

58:33.552 --> 58:35.596
<i>Ana-conda. </i>Get it?

58:36.096 --> 58:37.973
<i>Ana-conda</i>, 'cause of Ana.

58:38.057 --> 58:39.975
Can you just get in costume?

58:40.059 --> 58:41.310
Man, you know what?
You wouldn't even be here

58:41.393 --> 58:42.519
if it wasn't for me.

58:43.020 --> 58:44.772
Without me, you'd still
be stuck in Buffalo

58:44.855 --> 58:47.149
shooting your bullshit
wedding videos.

58:47.233 --> 58:49.026
[breathes heavily] Films.

58:49.109 --> 58:50.945
Yeah, you can
tell yourself that.

58:51.028 --> 58:53.822
My God, you know what?
I-- I-- I vouched for you too.

58:53.906 --> 58:54.865
Even the rights holders,

58:54.949 --> 58:56.116
they're like,
"Who is this guy?"

58:56.200 --> 58:57.785
I said, "Trust me. He's good."

58:57.868 --> 58:59.662
[boat approaching]

58:59.745 --> 59:00.746
What is that?

59:04.667 --> 59:06.126
[announcer]
<i>Attention, all crew.</i>

59:06.210 --> 59:09.546
<i>Let's get prepped</i>
<i>for scene 85, location Bravo.</i>

59:09.630 --> 59:10.965
<i>Five minutes.</i>

59:11.048 --> 59:12.383
[Claire]
Are they making a movie?

59:12.466 --> 59:14.134
[announcer]
<i>Five minutes to arrival.</i>

59:14.218 --> 59:17.429
Excuse me,
are you guys shooting a movie?

59:17.513 --> 59:19.640
We're doing a reboot
of <i>Anaconda.</i>

59:20.432 --> 59:21.433
[Doug] Come again?

59:21.976 --> 59:23.435
[crew member]
A reboot of <i>Anaconda.</i>

59:23.519 --> 59:24.728
<i>Anaconda</i>?

59:25.229 --> 59:27.398
- Like, Ice Cube <i>Anaconda</i>?
- Yeah.

59:27.481 --> 59:29.108
Sony is rebooting it.

59:29.650 --> 59:32.069
I know. No new ideas.

59:32.778 --> 59:34.780
[tense music playing]

59:46.125 --> 59:47.501
That's weird.

59:49.628 --> 59:51.005
So, let me get this straight.

59:51.630 --> 59:54.174
You don't have the rights
to <i>Anaconda</i>?

59:55.384 --> 59:56.385
No, well, I...

59:57.594 --> 59:58.887
Not legally.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:02.599
And you've never owned
the rights to <i>Anaconda</i>?

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:07.062
I mean, who owns <i>Anaconda</i>?

01:00:07.146 --> 01:00:09.940
Sony. Sony owns <i>Anaconda.</i>

01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:11.191
Yeah, no, no, I know. I know.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.194
I mean, like, you know, like,
in the larger sense.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:16.655
Why would you tell us
that you had the rights

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:19.241
to the goddamn
<i>Anaconda </i>franchise

01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:21.660
when you very much
don't have the rights

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:24.121
to the goddamn
<i>Anaconda </i>franchise?

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:26.957
Do we... [stammers] ...really
even need the rights?

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.584
Really? I mean, like,
who gives a shit?

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:32.171
- About IP?
- Yeah.

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:34.423
Literally everyone. [chuckles]

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:37.468
That's what big movies are!
That's why we're here!

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:38.719
You think that's
why we're here?

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:40.095
Yes, that's why we're here!

01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:41.555
We almost died!

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:45.517
We're out in the middle of
the goddamn jungle for a lie!

01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:47.144
I had to lie!

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.896
I had to lie to you!

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.105
You wouldn't have
come otherwise!

01:00:50.189 --> 01:00:52.024
You wouldn't...
None of you would have--

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.777
- [groans] Bullshit!
- [Griff] Not bullshit.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.112
It's why you never came out to
LA with me in the first place,

01:00:57.196 --> 01:01:00.157
even though we had
a whole plan to work together.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.243
Your whole life, you've just--
it's been dictated by fear.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.121
Griff,

01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:08.791
you're fired.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.168
- What?
- [Doug] You're fired.

01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:15.297
No. No, I'm not.

01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:17.091
You can't fire me.
You know why?

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.635
Because I quit already.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:21.470
Last night.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.350
I just didn't tell
anybody yet.

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:28.477
So...

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.607
Too bad for you, I guess,
because I already quit.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.692
[tense music playing]

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:49.998
Griff, wait!

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.668
Where are you even gonna go?

01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:54.169
To find the <i>Anaconda </i>boat.

01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:55.587
Maybe they can help me
get home.

01:01:55.671 --> 01:01:57.923
Just think about this.
It's not safe.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:01:59.383
That's a tiny boat.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:01.343
There's a giant snake
out there.

01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:05.681
Please don't do this.

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:09.852
Griff.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:16.567
[epic music playing]

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:39.006
[music fades]

01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:53.520
J.Lo?

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.189
Ice Cube?

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:59.776
Jon Voight?
Are you in this one?

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.903
[crew member screaming]
Help me!

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:02.279
Help me, man! Help me!

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:03.614
- Hey!
- Help me!

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:05.824
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Help! Help me!

01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:07.493
- Calm down. I'll come get you.
- Oh, my...

01:03:07.576 --> 01:03:09.536
It's okay. You're safe.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.954
- You're safe.
- Oh, thank God.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:13.874
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:16.627
- [yelps]
- [engine revving]

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:20.214
Oh, God!

01:03:21.882 --> 01:03:25.052
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.097
- [Claire] Doug!
- Mm-hmm?

01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:31.308
Doug, what's going on?
Why have we stopped?

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:35.270
Well, Ana found a great place
to shoot the next scene.

01:03:35.354 --> 01:03:36.647
- To shoot?
- The next scene? What?

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:39.316
Look. Look, okay, I know.
Losing Griff was hard,

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:41.818
but between the four of us,
we can finish this film.

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:43.195
I'm not going home
empty-handed.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.489
Come on, man. Without Griff...

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:47.115
That's not part of the plan.

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:50.035
Well, plans change and that's
part of filmmaking too.

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:52.120
No, no, Doug,
we have to go back for him.

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:53.539
- He's not safe out there.
- Yeah.

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:55.290
Ana. We need to turn
the boat around.

01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:57.125
We are not turning
the boat around.

01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:58.961
Yeah, we're not turning
the boat around.

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:01.380
Everyone off the boat now.

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.297
What's going on?

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:03.966
[tense music playing]

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:06.134
Ana, what are you doing?

01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:07.886
This definitely isn't the plan.

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:09.846
Well, plans change, Doug.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.431
Isn't that filmmaking?

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:12.349
[gun cocks]

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.560
And every good film needs
a bit of a twist.

01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:18.021
Everyone off the boat now!

01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:22.568
[tense music playing]

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:02.149
Oh...

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:11.366
[Ana] To the dock.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.307
[Kenny strains, grunts]

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.145
You're gonna carry these for
me back to the boat. Let's go.

01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:41.271
And then what?

01:05:42.314 --> 01:05:43.523
And then you're gonna
shoot us?

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:44.650
Now!

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.235
I'm not going anywhere

01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:49.529
until you tell me
what's inside these bags.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.990
You wanna look at it?
Look at it.

01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:55.702
Huh.

01:05:59.665 --> 01:06:01.958
[Claire] Wait. Is...
Is that...

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:04.419
Gold?

01:06:04.503 --> 01:06:07.381
So you're the miner?
You did all of this for money?

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.548
Very quick, Claire.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.009
- [Doug exclaims]
- No!

01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:14.429
I'm not gonna be part
of your sick quest for--

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:15.347
[Kenny] Ooh! Holy shit.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.264
[in Portuguese] Drop it.

01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:17.933
Drop the gun.

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:19.768
The gun.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:22.354
Now!

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:23.647
Calm down.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.027
[in English] And you, don't move!

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:31.571
[panting]

01:06:33.407 --> 01:06:34.574
I'm with the government.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:36.618
We track illegal gold miners.

01:06:36.702 --> 01:06:37.786
And Ana here runs one

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.413
of the biggest rings
in Brazil.

01:06:39.538 --> 01:06:40.622
[Ana speaking Portuguese]

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:42.541
This gold can change your life.

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:44.418
You think I care about gold?

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:45.669
Don't trust anything she says.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:47.796
She's a liar.
She's a damn liar.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.506
We're filmmakers from Buffalo.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:52.008
We're working on
a spiritual sequel to <i>Anaconda</i>

01:06:52.092 --> 01:06:53.385
and I don't know
if she mentioned that,

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:54.720
but it's not just a reboot,

01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:56.596
and I kicked out my friend
who had the lead,

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.890
and I gave her
a juicy-ass role,

01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:00.142
- and this is how she treats--
- [Kenny] Really juicy!

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:02.853
Shut up! I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.896
Off-topic. Go, arrest her.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.064
Oh, thank God.

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:08.108
[speaking Portuguese]

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.284

- [gasps]
- Oh, my God!

01:07:22.748 --> 01:07:24.374
Who shot me?

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:27.294
That'd be me, asshole.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.963
Griff, no. He was a good guy.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.923
- I'm a good guy.
- He's a cop.

01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:33.049
Look, I don't-- What?

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.052
I'm a good guy.

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:37.471
Drop it. On your knees now,
the four of you,

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.680
facing the water.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:41.975
- [Kenny] Wait. I--
- Now.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.353
[snake growling]

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:52.694

01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:58.909
No, no, Ana.
Don't-- Don't do this.

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:00.702
[Ana] You too, Claire.
On your knees, now.

01:08:00.786 --> 01:08:02.454
You don't have
to be this person.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:07.000
I have children at home.
They're 10 and 13.

01:08:07.501 --> 01:08:08.502
Please.

01:08:09.044 --> 01:08:10.253
Please.

01:08:10.337 --> 01:08:12.255
Think about what
you're doing to my kids.

01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:14.341
Just shut your mouth.
Turn around now.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:16.927

01:08:22.224 --> 01:08:23.391
On your knees.

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:25.352
Now!

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.895
[both grunting]

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.107

01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:32.025
[groans]

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.861
For the record, that's
how you headbutt, bitch!

01:08:35.362 --> 01:08:37.155
[Ana breathes heavily]

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:40.492
You won't do it.

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:42.744
You don't have the balls.
I know you, Claire.

01:08:42.828 --> 01:08:43.870
You don't know me.

01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:45.580
I don't even have kids.

01:08:46.623 --> 01:08:47.499
[Claire yelps]

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.084
[muffled grunts]

01:08:49.918 --> 01:08:51.711
[gasping, grunting]

01:08:53.213 --> 01:08:54.256
Jesus Christ!

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:55.382
[Claire, Doug gasp]

01:08:57.968 --> 01:08:59.135
[muffled grunting]

01:09:00.262 --> 01:09:03.598
- [Doug pants] What a snake!
- No. No, wait. Wait.

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:05.183
I think the boat
is back that way!

01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:07.310
Yeah, but so is the snake.
We can't go that way!

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:09.813
We gotta take this trail
and get to the high ground.

01:09:09.896 --> 01:09:12.065
- [Doug] Wait. What's that?
- [Claire, Kenny] What?

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.567
- [Griff] What?
- [screams]

01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:14.651
Oh, shit!

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.570
- [whimpering]
- [Claire] Oh, my God.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:17.529
Did it bite you?

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:18.738
Yeah, you know what,
I think it bit me.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.699
- I think it got me.
- Dougie, I know it hurts,

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.200
but we gotta get out
of here now

01:09:22.284 --> 01:09:23.785
because the snake
is out there!

01:09:23.869 --> 01:09:26.830
I'm sorry, I can't move.
My leg is freaking out.

01:09:26.913 --> 01:09:28.665
[cries] What are we gonna do?

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.750
We're gonna have to piss
on you, man.

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:32.752
- Huh?
- On the bite.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.045
It's the only way.

01:09:34.129 --> 01:09:35.589
I thought that
was just jellyfish.

01:09:35.672 --> 01:09:38.258
No, no, no, no.
It's all animals.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.801
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

01:09:39.885 --> 01:09:41.928
Someone's gotta piss.
I need one of your pisses.

01:09:42.012 --> 01:09:44.055
I'd love to be able
to help out, but I'm just--

01:09:44.139 --> 01:09:47.267
I am drained,
tapped, bone-dry.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.935
Claire, you wanna
take care of this?

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:50.437
I'm wearing a onesie.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.981
Kenny, we don't have time
to argue about this. You're up.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:54.774
You know this isn't possible.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.443
Why not?

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:57.777
Because he's...

01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.821
Pee shy.

01:09:59.905 --> 01:10:00.739
Pee shy?

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:02.032
[Kenny] I have urinary
stage fright.

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:04.951
I haven't been able
to pee in public in 35 years.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:06.620
My life sucks!

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:07.704
You can do this.

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.289
You have to do this.

01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:11.291
Whiz on me.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:13.043
- [Griff] You got it, buddy.
- Okay.

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.962
- [Griff] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:17.255
- You can do it.
- [Griff] You can do it.

01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:19.716
- Let it flow.
- Let it flow. Yeah.

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.052
Just piss on me. Come on.
Whiz on me.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:23.887
Whiz on me. Do it. Whiz on me.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.556
You...
You don't think I want to?

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.768
I would love to piss
all over you, man.

01:10:30.477 --> 01:10:32.020
But it's not in the cards!

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:34.314
- Whiz on me. Now.
- I can't. I'm trying.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.025
- You can do it! Whiz on me!
- I'm trying my hardest!

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:38.985
Do it, Ken! Do it, Ken.
Do it. Do it.

01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:40.862
That is an order!
Whiz on me now!

01:10:40.946 --> 01:10:43.198
Okay! Okay.

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.283
[Griff] You got it, buddy.
You do it.

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:48.328
- There's one more problem.
- What?

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:50.330
I haven't told you about this.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.123
I can only pee sitting down.

01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:53.667
Jesus Christ!

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.251
I need a chair.

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.130
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:01.299
Come on, buddy.

01:11:01.383 --> 01:11:02.968
Come on, Kenny.
Come on, come on.

01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:04.219
Just do it. Do it!

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:05.845
- Come on, buddy.
- [Kenny] Do it.

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:07.055
Come on, buddy.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:08.682
[suspenseful music playing]

01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:13.937
[urine trickling]

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.314
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:18.858
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- [Griff] Nice!

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:22.028
- Yes! Yeah!
- [Doug] Yeah! Yeah!

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.488
[no audible dialogue]

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.198
[triumphant music playing]

01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:35.834
Yeah!

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.512
[animals chittering]

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.810
[Doug breathing heavily]

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.770
[Doug whispering]
Griff, I'm sorry about

01:11:55.854 --> 01:11:58.106
what I said before
on the boat.

01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:01.151
The truth is,

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:04.112
I've been jealous of you
for a long, long time.

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:05.488
Jealous?

01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:07.782
For having the balls
to do what I couldn't.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:09.242
For going after
what you wanted.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.411
Going to LA
and putting yourself on the--

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:13.913
[muffled grunting]

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.331
Oh, my God!

01:12:15.457 --> 01:12:17.083
- [Kenny] Oh, shit!
- Doug!

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:18.376
[Kenny] Oh, my God!

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:20.170
[Claire gasping]

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.172
We have--
We have to go after him!

01:12:22.714 --> 01:12:23.715
[Kenny]
We gotta get out of here.

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:24.924
We do not have a choice.
Come on.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.351
[Claire panting]

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:36.936
Griff.

01:12:38.563 --> 01:12:40.315
Oh, Griff.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:42.901
[breathing heavily] Oh.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:44.527
What did I do?

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.238
I tricked him
into coming here,

01:12:47.322 --> 01:12:48.490
and now he's dead.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:52.077
No. No.
We all chose to be here.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.369
I wish it was me.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:55.413
It should be me.

01:12:55.497 --> 01:12:57.999
This is not your fault,
and we have to keep going.

01:12:58.083 --> 01:13:02.295
Hey, guys, I think I found out
which way we should go.

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:06.007
[suspenseful music playing]

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:17.560
Hey.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:19.938
[panting]

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:21.523
It's a...

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:23.024
It's a big open field.

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:25.401
We gotta get across it
to get to the boat.

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:26.861
But we can't just run across.

01:13:26.945 --> 01:13:28.154
It's too exposed.

01:13:28.822 --> 01:13:30.323
The snake could come
from anywhere.

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:33.660
Maybe we can create
a distraction.

01:13:34.786 --> 01:13:37.997
Yeah, yeah, maybe, but,
I mean, how do we do that?

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.374
[breathes heavily]

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:41.334
- I mean, it's gonna be... What?
- [shushes]

01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:44.045
[leaves rustling]

01:13:50.135 --> 01:13:51.678
[growling]

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:56.891
It's here.

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:23.418
[gasps]

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:25.712
[flies buzzing]

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:26.796
What?

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:28.673
What?

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:31.759
Oh, my God. Doug. Doug, no.

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:34.804
Oh, Dougie. Dougie.

01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:37.098
- Come on, man.
- [Claire] Is he...

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:40.310
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- [shushes]

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:42.729
[Claire crying]

01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:46.649
Wait. Wait.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:52.864
Maybe Doug is the distraction.

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:55.992
[sobs] How?

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.161
I know this is horrible, okay?

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:01.497
But if we can drag Doug out
into the field,

01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:02.957
prop him up

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.586
and attach the boar
to his back

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:09.297
wouldn't we make it
really hard

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.882
for the snake to swallow him?

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.635
It'll occupy the snake
long enough

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:15.511
for us to get across the field

01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:16.763
and get back to the boat.

01:15:17.305 --> 01:15:19.724
Mmm, it's a really smart idea.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.769
[Kenny straining]

01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:26.022
Oh, guys, this is horrible.

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:27.232
If it meant saving all of us,

01:15:27.315 --> 01:15:28.608
I'm sure Doug
would've wanted this.

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.568
I'm not sure
he would've wanted this.

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:31.527
Wait.

01:15:31.611 --> 01:15:32.612
We gotta go, guys.

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:34.364
[Claire] What are you gonna do?
What are you doing?

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:36.032
[stammers, sighs]

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:38.159
Snakes,
they love squirrel meat.

01:15:38.243 --> 01:15:39.244
[Claire groans]

01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:41.996
[Kenny grunting]

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:44.165
[kisses]

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:51.464
[suspenseful music playing]

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:54.884
[all panting]

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:57.553
Wait, the snake
is right behind him.

01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:02.517
[ethereal music playing]

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.602
[growling]

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:09.941
Oh.

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:14.320
I can't... [stammers]

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:23.496
[grunts]

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:24.789
Oh, shit!

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:26.124
[muffled grunting]

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.045
- He's alive! He's alive!
- He's alive!

01:16:31.129 --> 01:16:33.047
- Thought you checked his pulse!
- I did!

01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:35.133
[Griff]
Well, you did a shitty job!

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:36.384
What the fuck?

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:37.302
[playful music playing]

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.846
- [Kenny] Doug! Watch out! Run!
- [Griff] Doug! Run!

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.639
Come on, Doug, run!

01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:44.309
- [Kenny] Hey!
- [Griff] Run! Faster!

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:45.476
Hey.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.478
- Doug, run!
- Doug!

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:48.354
What?

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:50.398
- He's right behind you!
- What?

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:52.942
- [Griff] Run, Doug!
- [Kenny] Doug!

01:16:53.026 --> 01:16:54.027
[anaconda growling]

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.236
Oh, shit!

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.738
Shit, shit.

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:59.907
Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Shit.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:01.868
Oh, shit.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:02.952
- Run!
- Run!

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.954
- Run, Doug! Run!
- Run!

01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:06.372
What the hell is on my back?

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:08.416
It's a long story! Just run!

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:09.584
[epic music playing]

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:10.543

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.172
[exclaiming]

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:17.091
Shit!

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:19.302
[yelling]

A long time ago,
a group of artists had a vision

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:30.240
to one day live their dream
of making a major motion picture.

01:29:30.324 --> 01:29:36.205
And last year, against all odds,
I'm proud to say that dream was realized.

01:29:40.334 --> 01:29:41.919
As my friend Kenny likes to say,

01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:46.048
the snake is a metaphor
for the monsters that come for all of us

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:47.841
if our dreams remain unrealized.

01:29:47.925 --> 01:29:51.136
And to be clear,
there's also a non-metaphor snake.
