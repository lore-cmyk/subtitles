1
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,208
How'd--
How'd it go in there with the feds?

2
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,625
Y-You've spoken with our IA team?

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,125
Several times, yes.

4
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,291
And they found your alibi suitable?

5
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,875
<i>There are eyes everywhere.</i>

6
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,541
<i>I know. I can feel them.</i>

7
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,541
<i>You just need to know that</i>
<i>I'm the only cop you can trust.</i>

8
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,958
<i>I don't feel like I have any protection.</i>

9
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,666
<i>And like I'm being watched.</i>
<i>I feel like I shouldn't have called.</i>

10
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,083
<i>It's good you called me. That was smart.</i>

11
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>I have the address now.</i>
<i>I know where you are.</i>

12
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,375
<i>How do I know</i>
<i>they're not tracing this call?</i>

13
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,125
<i>This is a burner phone. You're safe.</i>

14
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,000
<i>No one will know you're speaking to me.</i>
<i>You'll be okay.</i>

15
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,333
<i>No, no, no. I feel like they know.</i>

16
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,458
<i>They don't know.</i>

17
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,875
<i>You just keep answering the phone</i>
<i>and doing what they say. Okay?</i>

18
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,250
<i>I'm scared.</i>

19
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,208
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>And I want out. I want out of here.</i>

20
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,791
I will get to you.

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,791
I'll protect you,
and I will pull you out of there.

22
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,250
Okay? Don't trust anyone.

23
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,791
<i>Okay. Call me soon, please.</i>

24
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:45,958
Bye.

25
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,291
They fucking killed Jackie, Thom.

26
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,708
What was she chasing? Do you know?

27
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,416
Money.

28
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,250
I think. A lot of it.

29
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,000
All right, I'm gonna level with you now,
Dane, because we're up against it.

30
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,833
The-The division's falling apart.

31
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,583
The feds, they want TNT dismantled.

32
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,500
And look at us. It's turning us
into cannibals, for Christ's sake.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,166
- Take a seat, please, Detective Ro.
- Ro.

34
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,416
There's been some developments,
and we want to keep pushing,

35
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,916
so we have a few more questions,
if you don't mind.

36
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,833
How would you describe
your relationship with Captain Velez?

37
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,750
She was my friend.

38
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:53,916
And my bitch.

39
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,958
She had my back.

40
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,000
She looked after me.

41
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,333
- And has her death in any way…?
- No, no, let's not "her death"…

42
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,500
And let's "her murder."

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,416
She was murdered.
Let's keep it real. Let's keep it a bean.

44
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,208
And how's that make you feel?

45
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,333
Shit makes me sick to my stomach.

46
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,250
Detective Salazar, we're re-interviewing
your entire TNT team.

47
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,375
No, it's…

48
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:21,958
It's just TNT.

49
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,291
Tactical Narcotics Team.
It's not "Tactical Narcotics Team Team."

50
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,666
All right, last time we spoke,
you described the job as follows:

51
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,583
"TNT works the dope game."

52
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:38,250
"We jump the hole,
seizures, drugs, guns, mostly cash."

53
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,375
Is that accurate?

54
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,166
That's correct.

55
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,083
Mostly cash.

56
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,041
Does that create conflict?

57
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,166
Conflict? What do you…
What do you mean?

58
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,333
Like we steal the money ourselves? No.

59
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,916
Those thoughts never cross your mind?

60
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,958
You heard about the inside heist teams?

61
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,541
Innuendo to that end, yeah.
Cops playing robbers, yeah.

62
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,541
And working with other
corrupt law enforcement elements.

63
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,458
When's the last time you guys caught
a cop killer in a conference room?

64
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,541
I'm curious.

65
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,791
What's the play today, guys?
Besides trying to dirty up some cops.

66
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,208
That's probably the easiest work you can
get right now in the city of Miami.

67
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,875
Are you gonna look me
in the eye and tell me

68
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,000
that you think somebody
in TNT killed Jackie?

69
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,208
I didn't say that. Did I say that?

70
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,666
Then what is this?

71
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,666
This is fucking Hail Mary bullshit.

72
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,208
Trying to put this together
with popsicle sticks and glue.

73
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,166
What the fuck is happening?

74
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,500
Where's the…
Where's the fucking task force?

75
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,708
- Why hasn't the world stopped?
- Dane…

76
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,875
No, I don't get it.
I really don't. It makes no sense.

77
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,708
Thom, you got a dead…

78
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,541
Miami police captain.

79
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,708
Because you guys blew it.
Can't catch a cop killer.

80
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,583
Maybe that's because the killer is a cop.

81
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:03,916
Christ.

82
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,791
- You wanna put the cigarette out?
- No, I don't.

83
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,125
- What else?
- All right.

84
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,000
So far, we've interviewed
Baptiste, Salazar, Ro.

85
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,833
We've interviewed your current commander.

86
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,458
You know, the guy that just took
your promotion, Dane Dumars.

87
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,208
Who deserved that bump as much
as anybody in this department.

88
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:30,083
You aware of what that guy's been through?
His marriage, his kid?

89
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,500
You two are close?

90
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,166
Very. Which is why I don't sit around
and piss and moan

91
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,708
about him getting fucking promoted.
Because Dane works for a living.

92
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,041
- Like I do.
- Right.

93
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,750
By the way, that was your bosses.

94
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,916
Your fucking genius brain trust
that helped bust up VCAT.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,666
- VCAT? I'm not familiar…
- Violent Criminal Apprehension Team.

96
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,250
And the reason they were shut down

97
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,291
was because of widespread
and rampant criminal corruption.

98
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,083
Not a lot of straight-A students.

99
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,750
But superb fucking murder police.

100
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,083
And you guys fucking torched the place.

101
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,208
Which further
hamstrings Jackie's investigation

102
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,291
because now all the VCAT guys,

103
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,708
not just the bent ones,
are buried fucking alive.

104
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,375
Are they approving any overtime?

105
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,875
No, Dane, no. God, no.
Not with budgets, too.

106
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,375
It's not a hill
anyone's willing to die on.

107
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,083
And VCAT being shut down
has really hurt us.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,125
All right, so let us run it.

109
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,333
- No.
- We'll run it off hours.

110
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,041
Dane, if they got wind
that TNT was conducting

111
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,583
a clandestine investigation
of their own captain's murder,

112
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,208
they'd burn us at the stake
and feed the feds a barbecue.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,166
Were you and Captain Velez close?

114
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,083
Were you in a relationship?

115
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,458
You gonna answer the question?

116
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,250
Is this what we're doing now?

117
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,500
Cat got your tongue?

118
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,208
- You fucking cunt.
- You'll say shit to anyone, right?

119
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,791
- I called him a cunt. Write it down.
- You got nothing to say now, J.D.?

120
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,250
You're a cunt.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,291
Are you fucking bozos here
because you think Jackie was dirty?

122
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,708
Was she?

123
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,583
Be very careful, Del.

124
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,375
Fuck you.

125
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,083
Let's not pretend

126
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,833
that you don't have a huge
personal stake in this, because you do.

127
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,166
All right? I know you do.

128
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,333
Everybody fucking knows you do.

129
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,833
So why don't you tell us

130
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,500
about that double-shoulder rig
you're wearing there, Wild West, huh?

131
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,250
You a fucking cowboy?

132
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,791
One of those guns is yours, right?
Who's the other belong to?

133
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,708
And what are you gonna do with it?

134
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,375
- Fuck you.
- What's wrong with you?

135
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,791
- Hey! Hey!
- Fucking piece of shit!

136
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,083
Fuck off.

137
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,750
- You fucking cunt! Fuck you!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

138
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,625
What the fuck is he doing?

139
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,833
He's fighting with his brother.

140
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:19,833
Hey, hey, hey!

141
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,708
- Come on, stop!
- Get the fuck off me!

142
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,375
Get him the fuck out of here!

143
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,500
What the fuck, man?
You're a fucking bully!

144
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, his brother's a fed.

145
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,416
Jesus Christ.

146
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,916
Hey, so you saw your brother.
How'd that go?

147
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, he's still an asshole.

148
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,041
You know,
it's like the same fucking thing.

149
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,041
Look, you want to have
a conversation with me,

150
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,500
have a conversation with me.

151
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,625
The guy became a fed so he could
talk down to people. I'm convinced.

152
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,250
Well, was he hoping for a confession?

153
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,458
No, I don't know
what anybody's hoping for right now.

154
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,208
This is bad, Dane.

155
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,666
If they're here, after all this time,
looking at us,

156
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,083
it means they have no fucking idea.

157
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:12,000
- Jackie's basically an afterthought.
- She's not even that. I mean…

158
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,125
I don't think they're gonna clear it.

159
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,791
Have a funeral,
fold the flag for your family,

160
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,250
and fuck you. Thanks for your service.

161
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,916
Either they think Jackie's dirty

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,625
or they think we had
something to do with it.

163
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,916
Yeah, or both.
Or they have no fucking idea.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,125
It's the easiest place to lay it on.
Just hang it on a dirty cop.

165
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,541
What did fucking Thom
with an H have to say?

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,666
That guy just got his dick
knocked in by the grind, man.

167
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,916
He's done. He's not gonna help us.

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,458
Everybody's got a fucking excuse.
We're all working hard.

169
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,333
It's a job. Go out and fucking do it.

170
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,291
If it's me, I throw chum in the water.

171
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,750
I fucking shake it up. I yank the line.
I see what comes to the fucking surface.

172
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,625
- You know what I mean?
- Exactly. You get some fucking movement.

173
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,583
Fucking see who starts talking,
see who starts making mistakes.

174
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,708
- Some fucking cop shit.
- Just fucking basic shit, man.

175
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,250
I hate it here now, man. I hate it.

176
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,875
I hate being a cop.

177
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,041
I've been waking up

178
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,250
every night

179
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,125
like…

180
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,916
thinking about time.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's like how much has passed
and how much I got left.

182
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,875
What the fuck I'm gonna do with it.

183
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,166
It's not fair.

184
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,833
I don't know what to tell you.

185
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,750
Maybe it's that shit Jackie
used to say, I always made fun of, like,

186
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,083
"Well, just live to see another sunrise."

187
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,583
Maybe that was the whole key to life.
"Just live to see another sunrise."

188
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,833
Jackie… believed in witches, man.

189
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,625
You're the problem with the
culture of the police department today.

190
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:11,708
It's this kind of judgment.
A lot of people believe in witches and…

191
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,666
Jackie believed in spirit animals.

192
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,708
Yeah, I used to like your fucking spirit.
Let's go get cranked.

193
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,750
- What do you say?
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

194
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,000
Keep the donuts going, boys. Yeah!

195
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,500
Do we have spare fucking tires?
Hey, guys, chill out.

196
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,166
- Ho!
- Hell, yeah.

197
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,500
The champ is here.

198
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,625
The champ is here.

199
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,750
Can we not be doing this dumb shit
in the fucking parking lot like idiots?

200
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,208
It's not high school.

201
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,958
I was gonna bet on your brother,
but we broke it up too fast.

202
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,458
Wouldn't be the first bad bet you made.

203
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,916
"You're a bully!"

204
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,416
Who the fuck says that?

205
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,375
No, on some real shit, though.
What is going on with this cash?

206
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,083
Everything is just money, money, money.

207
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,166
You know, we dope cops,
so I'm trying to make this make sense.

208
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,166
You think it's those stash house hits
we've been hearing about?

209
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,708
- What the hell are those?
- Some bullshit.

210
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,750
It's cartel houses supposedly
getting knocked over by cops and feds,

211
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,666
money disappears…
Heist teams are an urban fantasy.

212
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,750
You run into a big fucking stash house,
you let me know. Okay?

213
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay, buddy?

214
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,666
Look at this shit.

215
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,166
Roll up in a fucking tank.

216
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,208
When's the last time you had to arrest
somebody and you needed a tank?

217
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,333
See, this is the kind of shit
I like. Big tanks, big wheels.

218
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,625
You like that?

219
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,083
But small guy.

220
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,958
Look at that jump.

221
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,208
It's unbelievable, the fucking artillery
and the machine guns. Okay.

222
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,458
- Hey.
- Captain America!

223
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,416
You get the Red Skull yet?

224
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,333
Dude, DEA doesn't have
their own staging area?

225
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,833
You're always using our parking lot
for your fucking armada.

226
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,291
I'm bestowing overtime
on my former brethren in blue

227
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,541
so they can make
their fucking mortgage payments.

228
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,541
Oh, I see.

229
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,625
Maybe this is the motherfucker
knocking over the stash houses

230
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,666
with the cabal of Miami's finest
and feds put together.

231
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,958
I'm DEA, Byrne,
so that makes me Miami's finest.

232
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,541
Ask your fucking crooked cops
you socialize with.

233
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,791
- Y'all look fucking dirty.
- I look fucking good.

234
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,500
- Not you.
- Dayo. What's up, <i>cabrón?</i>

235
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,791
What's up?
What's hot on the streets, hoes?

236
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,041
And what? Are things any better?

237
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,958
Until they catch our cop killer, no.

238
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,041
Dominoes, motherfucker!

239
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,833
You know, I really fucking feel
like they trying to fire us.

240
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,916
They on our ass
and I don't like it one bit.

241
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,916
They're not gonna let
a cop's body get cold,

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,125
especially a captain who'll blow
a big-time media frenzy murder case.

243
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,208
If VCAT didn't get disbanded,
arrest would have happened by now.

244
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,875
Oh, yeah? What's DEA doing for us,
just out of curiosity?

245
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,250
<i>- Nada.</i>
<i>- Nada.</i>

246
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,583
- Well, come on.
- Not a fucking thing.

247
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,541
It's not our fucking
front porch, now, is it?

248
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,666
- Handle your scandal, officers.
- Okay.

249
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,541
I'll keep that in mind
when you get fucked up.

250
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,166
I'll tell you this. There's fucking
snitches in every division.

251
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,791
Speaking of which,
you look a little snitchy.

252
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,458
Oh, fuck. There he is. Look at that.

253
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,500
The most corrupt cop
in all of fucking Dade.

254
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,708
- Hi, Matty.
- Second!

255
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,708
- How's it going, man?
- Trying to find a fuck to give.

256
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,916
What's up, L.T.?

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,083
Okay. Hey, TFOs, let's go.
You wanna make some money today or what?

258
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,625
What are you fucking doing?
You playing fucking dominoes?

259
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,583
We had a Crimestopper tip come in.

260
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,333
- Just now?
- Yep.

261
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,291
It's a quarter past quitting time.

262
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,000
It's money up in a house in Hialeah.

263
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,125
I wanna rip it.
Don't wanna end the week on a goose egg.

264
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,875
- Overtime?
- No. This is extra credit.

265
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,458
I need Wilbur, too.

266
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:38,166
- L.T., come on, man. No overtime? Why?
- Budgets. I can't do it.

267
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,083
So they get
to just fucking pay their bills,

268
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,958
and we don't get to fucking pay our bills?
Make it make sense.

269
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,750
I'm going regardless,
so do what you want, but I do need Wilbur.

270
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,083
We need a money dog.
Take your own cars. Follow me out.

271
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,375
- That's fucked up.
- He's asleep in my fucking car. Fuck.

272
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,166
Yo!

273
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,375
How much they said was in here?

274
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,833
Don't know. 250 maybe?

275
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,583
Word? Oh, shit.

276
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,500
All right, bet. That's fucking easy rip.

277
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,083
- Friday night?
- Yep.

278
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,375
L.T. Hey.

279
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,583
You mentioned Hialeah.
So we wanna get local PD involved?

280
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,208
Absolutely not.
That entire department's upside down.

281
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,041
How much is this rip supposed to be?

282
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,583
- 150K.
- A doper?

283
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,666
Detective, can you sense
my patience fraying

284
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,458
in real fucking time
from these questions?

285
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,041
Sorry, my bad. Force of habit.

286
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,333
All right, what do we tell 'em?

287
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,208
A lie.

288
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,958
Fucking houses all look abandoned.

289
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,166
Get them to sign a consent to search
for dope instead of money.

290
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,666
Yeah, we out here looking like a goddamn
Halloween costume for cops.

291
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,791
What the hell going on?
Ain't it supposed to be a madhouse?

292
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,083
What if they don't sign
because it actually is a dope hole?

293
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,125
Well, then it's a protective search.
We clear the place anyway.

294
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,791
Wilbur, come on, baby.

295
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,583
Good boy, Wilbur. Good boy.

296
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,875
What do we got?

297
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,958
I've never seen him alert like this, boss.
He's going crazy.

298
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,166
How much are they holding?

299
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,666
75 grand.

300
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,875
That's impossible.
He's peeing all over the house.

301
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,083
There has to be a lot more money inside.

302
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,625
Knock, knock. Miami PD.

303
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,875
- Knock, knock.
- How you doing this evening, miss?

304
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,125
Well, five cops magically appear
at my doorstep. I've been better.

305
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,416
We had a Crimestopper tip
come in on this address.

306
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,541
- A what stopper? What?
- It's called a Crimestopper tip.

307
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,708
Said maybe there's some narcotics
on the premises.

308
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,083
They're typically pretty reliable,
so we just gotta follow up.

309
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,583
What's your name?

310
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,500
Desi.

311
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,250
That's your rock star name.
What's your full legal name?

312
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,583
Desiree Lopez Molina.

313
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,458
Do you have any ID? Driver's license?

314
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,500
Inside.

315
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,541
- Any animals in the house? Pets?
- Just me.

316
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,625
You alone here?

317
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,000
Just me.

318
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,250
Do you mind if we come inside?

319
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,791
- Do you have a warrant?
- We have a consent to search.

320
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,041
What's the difference?

321
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:03,166
The difference is we don't need a judge
to sign and approve a consent to search.

322
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,541
So I can say no.

323
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,500
- You can say no. Sure.
- And what would you say to that?

324
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,166
Well, you would have to say no first.

325
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,125
I don't have drugs in here.

326
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,375
- Maybe a bit of weed.
- You don't have to worry about that.

327
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,625
Sign the paper and we'll be in and out.
We want to go home, too.

328
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,583
Don't do any of that pushy cop shit,
all right?

329
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,958
What? Do I look like a pushy cop?
These guys are the pushy cops.

330
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,375
Trust me.
That's who you don't want to fuck with.

331
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,500
Yeah, we're good.

332
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,958
What the fuck, guys?

333
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,458
Come on, Wilbur.

334
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,583
That's that pushy cop shit
I was talking about.

335
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,500
Get it. Get it. Let's go.

336
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,916
All right, Numa, go long. Mike, go right.

337
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,291
Come on.

338
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,750
Stay right by me.

339
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,916
I'm letting him off leash.

340
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,583
Go. Go.

341
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,166
Is there anybody else in this house, Desi?

342
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,125
Just me.

343
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,250
The last thing you want to do
is lie to us right now.

344
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,625
Promise, just me.

345
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,000
All right, Wilbur, down! Shh! Wilbur.

346
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,500
- Lolo, come get the dog.
- Clear.

347
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,333
It's okay. Stop.

348
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,250
Hey, what's in this attic, Desi?
What's up there?

349
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,125
- Come on, come on.
- Don't know. Never been.

350
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,125
I already told you,
I don't have any drugs.

351
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,041
Dog doesn't alert for drugs.
Alerts for money.

352
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,541
I-I think I'm going to need
that warrant now.

353
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,458
Nah, dog alerted to something.

354
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,625
We don't need a warrant.
We got probable cause.

355
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,625
Desi, is there anybody in the attic?

356
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,666
No.

357
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,583
- Okay, go.
- Clear.

358
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,416
Desi?

359
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:43,958
Yeah?

360
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,416
Why is this attic so clean?

361
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:51,083
I already said, I don't know.
Never been up there.

362
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,125
Why does it matter?

363
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,833
Well, 'cause the rest of your house
looks like a fucking landfill,

364
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,125
and this is spotless.

365
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,958
You should have seen this place
before I started cleaning it up.

366
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,541
<i>Mi abuela, </i>she just
never threw anything away.

367
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,291
Hey, look at this.

368
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,666
Electrical wire
shouldn't be sticking out like that.

369
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,583
What the fuck is that?

370
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,041
All right, get the sledge.

371
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,625
All right, so how long
have you lived here, Desi?

372
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,791
Two months.

373
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,208
And you mentioned your <i>abuela,</i>
is she still around?

374
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

375
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,791
She passed away in June.

376
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,875
I had been taking care of her
the last few years.

377
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,833
- By yourself?
- Yeah.

378
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,958
- Do you work?
- House is in probate.

379
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,916
I've been fighting my sister for it.

380
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,500
Bitch didn't lift a finger
for our grandmother,

381
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,916
and now she wants to contest her will.

382
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,125
Rest of the house is clear.

383
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,916
So, Desi,
before we get into that wall up there,

384
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,500
anything you want to tell us?
Maybe get ahead of it.

385
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,250
I actually really do not know
what's up there.

386
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,333
I swear on all I love.

387
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,708
I'm telling the truth.

388
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,208
I'd like to believe you, Desi,
but I've been doing this a long time,

389
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,125
and when I told you
the dog alerts for money,

390
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,583
I saw the look on your face,
and you were shook.

391
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,166
What do you think is behind the wall?

392
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,541
You guys brought a dog
that can smell money.

393
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:43,041
So, I mean, it's highly likely that
you know a lot more than I do, right?

394
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,208
Come on, Desi.

395
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:48,333
You got a Colombian flag hanging over
the fireplace downstairs, and we're cops,

396
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,541
so it kind of takes the mystery out
of who the money might belong to.

397
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,750
Oh, that's real small-minded of you.

398
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,250
- All Colombians aren't the same, you know?
- We're aware.

399
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,250
But they do have great coke.

400
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,750
In fact, all the coke
in the United States is Colombian.

401
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,958
- And they have great food, too. Yeah.
- I'm sure they do.

402
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,583
- They do.
- But they don't hide it in the wall.

403
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,250
All you cops have the same look
on your face.

404
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,041
The one that makes you feel like
you've done something wrong.

405
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,250
- Did you do something wrong?
- I didn't.

406
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:21,000
The receipt of stolen property,
knowingly or unknowingly, including cash,

407
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:24,208
does actually constitute doing something
very seriously wrong.

408
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:27,916
Desi, not seeing a crime does not
exonerate you from its commission.

409
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,875
- Not if it's in your fucking house.
- You understand?

410
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,916
Right, but it's not my home.

411
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,208
This is my grandmother's house, remember?

412
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,458
- Her estate is still in probate.
- Oh, yeah.

413
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,875
That's pretty slick, Desi.

414
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,500
Who gave you that loophole?

415
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,833
Come on.

416
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,500
I mean, we all love to
lecture and moralize, don't we?

417
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,625
Make better decisions.

418
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,250
Live a more honest life.

419
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,541
Leave it in God's hands.

420
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,208
But God isn't gonna
make the mortgage, is he?

421
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,500
End of the month, bills are due.

422
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,916
Medical bills.

423
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,000
Lawyer fees.

424
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,625
Funeral costs.

425
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,125
So tell me…

426
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,875
can you trade all that advice…

427
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,416
and prayer and good intention…

428
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,166
for cash?

429
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,000
No, I guess not. Desi, I guess not.

430
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,291
A-W-T-G-G.

431
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:42,666
What does it mean?

432
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:45,875
Are we the good guys?

433
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,083
Do you need validation
that you're a good guy?

434
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,958
Okay, sorry.

435
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,708
How about the other one? W-A-A-W-B?

436
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,250
We are and always will be.

437
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,375
What are they?

438
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,041
L.T. Bling bling!

439
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,041
- What do you got?
- I don't know. But it looks big.

440
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,958
Keep an eye on her.
Don't let her go anywhere.

441
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,458
This is fucking crazy.

442
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,291
Fucking boom.

443
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,083
The fuck?

444
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,875
Oh, shit.

445
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,583
Oh, shit…

446
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:55,458
Goddamn.

447
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,583
There's $1.4 million in this bucket.

448
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,166
That can't be. Is that real?

449
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,666
- What's that noise? It's big?
- Shit. Damn.

450
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,833
I eyeball 14 more
of those things at least.

451
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,833
- Oh, God.
- But that's… if they average…

452
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:08,041
Even more up there.

453
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,541
That's a $20 million Rip.

454
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,083
You ever seen this before?
What the fuck do we do?

455
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,791
Hold on.
Just fucking hold on for a second.

456
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,041
Give me just…

457
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,791
All right, guys. You know what?
Just… Can you step…

458
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,333
Step downstairs for a sec.
Give us a second.

459
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,541
- Huh?
- Give us one sec. We'll be right there.

460
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,375
Just… Let the L.T. just…

461
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,541
Fuck, dude.

462
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,708
You know what this means, right?

463
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:31,916
Jesus Christ, dude.

464
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,333
Hey, hey, phones.

465
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:34,958
- Phones.
- What?

466
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:36,750
What do you mean, our phones?

467
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,500
I don't want anybody calling now.

468
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,833
Give me your phones. Pass them up.

469
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:40,750
Hand your phone up.

470
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,041
- Dane, what are you doing?
- Hand your phone up.

471
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,166
You don't trust us, boss?

472
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,750
No, look, it's not--
I don't trust this fucking Rip, all right?

473
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,500
Money like this does fucked-up shit.

474
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,041
Just turn your pockets inside out.
I want your phones.

475
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,000
It's the fucking Rip, Numa. It's not you.

476
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,166
- Lolo, I need your phone.
- Okay.

477
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:57,666
- Hand it up.
- You're not a dirty cop, are you?

478
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,958
- I want everything. I want burners, 33s.
- I don't have burners.

479
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,083
- Seriously?
- Dane, what are you doing?

480
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,541
Let me get Lolo's phone.
I want Desi's phone, too.

481
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,208
- I want to do a rapid I.D.
- Give me your phone.

482
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,416
- Really?
- Yes, give me your phone.

483
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,000
- Are you serious?
- Hand me your phone.

484
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,083
L.T. It's…

485
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,291
One more, one more.

486
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,708
Hey, stop with the long fucking faces,
guys, all right?

487
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,083
It's not a fucking purity test.

488
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:19,083
I'm dealing with a fucking situation here.
I'm trying to get a handle on it.

489
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,833
You want my phone, too, man?

490
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,250
No, I don't want your fucking phone.

491
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,333
I want you to help me figure out
what the fuck this is.

492
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:26,541
Let's not start undermining our trust
in our fucking team…

493
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,750
Don't fucking tell me
what I can and can't do right now.

494
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,916
I'm fucking reacting, all right? I'm not
worried about fucking offending the team.

495
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,958
All right, we gotta be smart now.
This is about trust.

496
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:38,208
- Yes, yes.
- Dude, dude, it's me and you, okay?

497
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,791
How much was the tip that came in?

498
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,208
It said 300 grand.

499
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,708
The Crimestopper tip
that just got called in said 300?

500
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,333
300, 300.

501
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,583
Fuck.

502
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,750
- All right, we're in trouble, J.D.
- Yeah.

503
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:56,416
A lot.

504
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,541
Okay, I want to tear out the rest
of these containers from the wall.

505
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,791
We gotta prep a count right now.

506
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:04,541
Mike, I want you to help Numa take them
into the garage, all right?

507
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,208
Because this is
all just drywall and plaster.

508
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:07,166
Why does that matter?

509
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,500
It's harder for a bullet to travel through
cinder block. That's why.

510
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,416
- Shit.
- Fuck.

511
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,083
- It's like that?
- It's exactly like that.

512
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,250
Please, just get it done.

513
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,000
Hey, man. Hey, Dane.

514
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,291
You gotta move this money, man.

515
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,166
No, I can't.

516
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,000
The rules are you count the money
at the site of the seizure.

517
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,666
- That's the fucking law, man.
- The rules, all right,

518
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,125
that doesn't apply to
a cubic ton of fucking cash, dude.

519
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:28,416
If we fuck this count up by one dollar,
IA is fucking up our ass.

520
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,750
Looking for asylum
if we fucking get this count wrong.

521
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,708
No, I'm not
not following procedure right now, man.

522
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,750
We gotta fucking count the money here.

523
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,833
All right, so we call the Major.

524
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,791
- Do you want to involve him?
- No, I don't want to fucking involve him.

525
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,125
You're talking about following protocol.
We can't pick and choose.

526
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,416
- Do you trust our command structure?
- Not particularly.

527
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,041
But we're coloring outside the lines.

528
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,375
- We get just as fucked for violating that…
- All right, I'm not risking it.

529
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:54,583
Dude, the longer we fucking stick around
here, the dicier this shit's going to get.

530
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,333
Look, I know. I'm fucking aware, man.

531
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,458
Okay, let me tell you something.

532
00:30:57,541 --> 00:31:00,166
Jackie told me that she was hip
to a big fucking Rip that was out there,

533
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,958
and I think that's what this is.

534
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,250
Look, I don't know. I don't know.

535
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,666
All I know is that fucking
what we do right now

536
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,708
and who we fucking talk to matters.

537
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:10,083
We gotta tighten our shit up.

538
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,375
- We gotta fucking close ranks.
- Boss…

539
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:15,625
I already missed visiting my girls.
Can I FaceTime them good night real fast?

540
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,291
Lolo, please understand
where we're at right now.

541
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,083
I understand, but this is the kind of shit
my ex crucifies me over, boss.

542
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,958
- Please, just a quick call.
- I cannot give you a phone. I am sorry.

543
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,541
It's a quick phone call. It's my girls.
I need to say goodnight to them.

544
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,625
It cannot be helped.
I'm sorry. I am. I am sorry.

545
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,875
But you gotta let me
get my head around this, please.

546
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,250
- Fuck me. Goddamn it.
- Let me call my brother, Dane.

547
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,625
No. Your fucking brother, the Fed,
who you were in a fistfight with today?

548
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:40,375
- Let's call Matty Nix at the DEA.
- No Feds, man. No, no. Goddamn it.

549
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,083
This is my scene. Let me run it, please.

550
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,208
All right, chain of command,
you're in charge. I get it.

551
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,791
- No, don't fucking do that, man.
- I'm not trying to step on your toes, man.

552
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:47,916
I'm trying to help you,

553
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,916
and you're treating me
like an asshole. Okay, lieutenant?

554
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,791
Run your fucking crime scene, but
I don't know what the fuck you're doing.

555
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,875
You're both making a big mistake.

556
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,833
You should just take
whatever money you want and walk away.

557
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,083
Before this goes really bad for all of us.

558
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,333
Hey!

559
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,250
Hey!

560
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:12,041
Hey, there's a black-and-white
coming up the street.

561
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,708
Stay off the radios. No call-outs.

562
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:18,583
Lolo, get the rest of those containers
with them. Get them to the garage.

563
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,125
What's going on, fellas?

564
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,208
This many Challengers
at the end of a block.

565
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,166
It's either bangers or UCs.

566
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,291
Yeah, we're on the job. TNT.

567
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,458
Could you cut your light bar?

568
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,250
We didn't get a heads up about this.

569
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,875
No, you didn't.

570
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,958
- Any reason why?
- Yeah. Only reason. You're Hialeah PD.

571
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,541
- And what's that mean, Sergeant?
- Patrolman.

572
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,458
Do you see the gold shield around my neck?

573
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,541
Means we can't fucking afford
what you charge to keep a secret.

574
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,791
I know you both outrank me…

575
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,666
but fuck that.

576
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,166
And fuck you both.

577
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,000
- We'll call my chief and complain…
- Hold on. I know you.

578
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,500
Shotgun, how do I know you?

579
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,250
- You don't know me.
- Uh, yeah, I do.

580
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,500
You never seen me.

581
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,375
You have a blessed night.

582
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,916
Officers.

583
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:05,125
Dipshit riding shotgun.
I recognize him. He was a VCAT cop.

584
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,041
What?

585
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:09,750
Yeah. I saw him all over Seven Seas.
I recognize that motherfucker for sure.

586
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,916
No, they fucking…
Half those guys got suspended.

587
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,875
- The rest of them got fucking fired.
- Yeah, or reassigned.

588
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:17,333
If a Catholic priest can do
all this shit and get reassigned,

589
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:19,500
- you don't think cops can…
- Not with the VCAT thing, man.

590
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,750
That was a fucking disaster.
Who kept their job after that?

591
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,875
Police unions. Trust me.

592
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,291
You think they're onto this place?

593
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:29,208
If these assholes knew what was in there,
we'd be fucking smoked already.

594
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:30,125
Yeah.

595
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,958
I think we're gonna get hit.

596
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,125
Yeah.

597
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,291
All right, let's get the rifles, vest up,
get a vest on the dog.

598
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,541
Live to see another sunrise, bro.

599
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,791
That's sage fucking advice tonight.

600
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,833
I don't understand why
they took our phones.

601
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,708
Do they not trust us?

602
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,416
You just worried about
this little side piece

603
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,750
you think we don't know about.

604
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,125
Your little fuck toy.

605
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,000
Probably texting your phone right now
like, <i>"Mami chula, </i>I miss you."

606
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,416
Are you guys just gonna leave me here?

607
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,916
- That's not true!
- Tell me what the fuck is going on!

608
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,375
<i>- Mami… </i>fucking, where you at?
- Fuck this!

609
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:41,416
No, I just wanted to see
my kids, man. I wanted to talk to 'em.

610
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,208
I feel you, baby. Listen,
we're gonna get your phone back, okay?

611
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:46,291
What is this?

612
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,333
I mean, Granny got the Yellow Pages.

613
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:53,833
At this point, if y'all wanna call 1987,
I'm your girl, I got you.

614
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:56,291
Granny wasn't playing.
I mean, she got everything in here.

615
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,541
She got everything
you need in here, every year.

616
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,541
Every decade, every century.

617
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,500
Oh, shit.

618
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,458
<i>Mi tio </i>had an old station wagon
just like this.

619
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,541
Fuck. I wonder if it still runs.

620
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,416
I doubt it. Everything in here old.

621
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,333
Hey, look, this is all fun…

622
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,333
But what the fuck are we doing?

623
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,791
- We count the seizures on site.
- Yeah.

624
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,958
Yeah, I know
we count the seizure on sight, Numa.

625
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,916
I'm talking about not contacting command.

626
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,291
Radioing in. Feels kind of funky.

627
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,833
Okay, well, it's L.T.'s call, baby.

628
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,208
What you tripping for?
We literally do this all the time.

629
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:30,416
I'm not trying to get jammed up.

630
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,458
This is not
how Jackie would handle this shit.

631
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:35,208
This is not jumping a dope hole.
This is a huge hit.

632
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,125
Act like you've been here before.
And then act like you're coming back.

633
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:41,750
Yeah, all right. Is that advice for me?
How sweet. Miss me with that bullshit.

634
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:42,791
- Whoa, whoa.
- All right?

635
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:45,000
- We're on our back foot right now.
- Wait, when did anyone

636
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,375
say otherwise?

637
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,125
It's how you handle the twist.

638
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,708
You need to chill, now. <i>Calmate. </i>Do you…

639
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,208
- Yeah.
- He need a nap.

640
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,208
And what are you doing?

641
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,291
Look, that's a shitty fiberglass door.

642
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,708
Let's move this car over there
for more cover, yeah?

643
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,708
Okay, great. Do you want me to help?

644
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,208
Yeah, just be on deck for the back door.

645
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,666
Okay, great.

646
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,833
All right, let's get our vests on,
tighten up.

647
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:15,125
Get your rifles, extra mags.
Let's get our shit together.

648
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,708
Those Hialeah cops must have
scared the shit outta you.

649
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,250
Safety first. What are you doing?

650
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:21,208
Trying to get this car to the garage door
so we can get cover.

651
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:23,791
Yeah, smart.

652
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:25,958
Where's the girl?

653
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,708
She's, um, handcuffed in the kitchen.

654
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,291
- Fuck you guys!
- Hey, Lolo…

655
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,708
Look, I know you're salty about
the phones, about the girls. I get it.

656
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,125
- It's all right.
- But look.

657
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:38,333
Please understand, it's not panic.
It's just precaution.

658
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,208
It's okay, boss. I got you.

659
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,541
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

660
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,166
Is this all the containers?

661
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,250
Yeah, that's all of them.

662
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,208
Okay.

663
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:48,458
All right, Mike. Why don't you head out
front and just keep a fucking eye out?

664
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,875
- If you see anything unusual, holler.
- We can move the car, Mike.

665
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,916
I don't know shit about any container.

666
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,875
So let's figure out a system
to count this.

667
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:56,833
What the fuck?

668
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:00,375
TEC-9.

669
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:03,708
There's a weapons charge for Desi.

670
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:04,791
Fuck this!

671
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,916
All right.

672
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,666
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

673
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,458
If it's labeled, 250, we leave it.

674
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,083
Just take their word for it. All right?

675
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:17,083
Don't touch it. Don't open it.
Don't fuck with it.

676
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,458
If it's janky and fucked up like this
and there's no label…

677
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,166
- Just count it.
- We gotta count it, all right?

678
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,500
Or else we'll be here for two days.

679
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:25,458
So anything unlabeled, we just count it.

680
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:28,083
Fuck me, it'll be so much easier
if we just stole this money.

681
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:30,083
I swear to God.

682
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:35,791
All right. We'll make two piles like that.
Dig through them. Now, that's not marked.

683
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:37,125
Marked.

684
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,583
I get a call to leave the house
for a few hours, and I do.

685
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:04,083
And they don't ID themselves?
The caller, you don't know who it is?

686
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,083
No, they don't, and I don't ask.

687
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:11,000
So, strangers, people you don't know…

688
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,333
- come in here into the house…
- I don't ask.

689
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:19,333
- And you've never seen the people?
- No, never.

690
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,500
You said take what we wanted
and walk away. Why?

691
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,208
That's what they told me to say.

692
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,625
They told you?
In case of this, in case of cops?

693
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,083
I don't think they meant
take all of it, but…

694
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,666
they know they're gonna take their losses,
so however much money you guys took

695
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,041
probably wouldn't amount to much,
not for them.

696
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,541
Who is that?

697
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,083
It's my son.

698
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,750
Desiree Lopez Molina.

699
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,916
You got a snitch jacket.

700
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,000
They redlined the report,
so it's hidden. Why?

701
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,125
Ex-boyfriend.

702
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,000
He sold drugs, and he stole money.

703
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,625
He's a bad guy, so I worked with the cops.

704
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,958
I didn't like it, or him.

705
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:26,916
Yeah, I can see that.

706
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,791
Was this dude addicted to jail
or just getting caught?

707
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:31,500
Can't tell.

708
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,375
Hey, look at this.
Redlined, check out the handler.

709
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:44,625
You a snitch, kid? Miami-Dade?

710
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,833
What happened? Somebody come by the house,
leave a business card?

711
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,000
Tell you to call back?

712
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:52,875
Is that what the tablet says?

713
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:55,208
Don't fuck around. It's one of two things.

714
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:58,125
Either you know how hot this fucking place
was and you wanted help,

715
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,333
or you'll dime out this stash
and make a little money.

716
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,000
Desi, a CI on a seizure in
the state of Florida can claim up to 20%.

717
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:05,916
Is that…

718
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:10,333
Is that what's happening? Cause a girl
can get rich snitching in South Florida.

719
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,000
Easy money.

720
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,500
Hey, I get it. What are you gonna do?

721
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:18,250
Grandmother dies, a couple of guys
show up from the cartels,

722
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:21,083
say, hope you don't mind if
we keep 20 million in your fucking attic.

723
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:24,666
What are you gonna do?
You against the whole fucking cartel?

724
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,291
Don't pick it up.

725
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,041
Hello?

726
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,833
<i>You have 30 minutes</i>
<i>to get the fuck out of that house.</i>

727
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,666
<i>Just do your job and take the money</i>
<i>that was supposed to be there.</i>

728
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,166
<i>No one needs to die over 150K.</i>

729
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,875
What was it? What did they say?

730
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,875
Apparently we have 30 minutes
to get out of the house.

731
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,208
Can I talk to you privately for a second?

732
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:13,666
No, please listen to them. They're gonna
come in here and kill everybody.

733
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,791
300 grand, right?

734
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,041
What?

735
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,916
When I asked you upstairs
how much was the Crimestopper tip for,

736
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,458
you said about 300,000.

737
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,416
- That's right.
- No. Wrong.

738
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,166
Because whoever just called
on the phone said,

739
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,833
"No one needs to die in there for 150K."

740
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,750
The guy on the phone said 150K?

741
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:43,125
Yeah. So why are you telling me
it's twice that, man?

742
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:44,541
First off…

743
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,291
- back the fuck up.
- No, man.

744
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,208
Don't tell me to back the fuck up.

745
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,916
Fuck you.
Tell me what's fucking going on, Dane.

746
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,291
Once more, for clarity, J.D.,

747
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:56,458
this is my crime scene.
I will run it the way I see fit.

748
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,833
You are not running shit
if what you plan to do

749
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:01,166
is torch what's left of my fucking career.

750
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,041
I will pop smoke on this thing and
go the fuck home. Do you understand that?

751
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,541
What, you think I want to jack this Rip?

752
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,416
Do you think I want to jack this Rip?

753
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,083
Dude, I don't know what you're doing, man.

754
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,291
Uh, y-you have not been yourself
since we've been here, okay?

755
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,333
I told you what Jackie told me.

756
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,791
And you are lying to me,
and you are holding shit back.

757
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:28,083
And don't tell me I'm imagining shit
'cause I've known you too long.

758
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:29,500
What is going on?

759
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:34,041
I want to see the Crimestopper tip.

760
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,833
I want to see the piece of paper.
I want to see the tip.

761
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:36,791
Just the tip?

762
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,541
Motherfucker, I am so far
from seeing the fucking humor in this!

763
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:44,375
Do you understand me? I don't trust you
right now, and that's a fucking problem!

764
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,458
Take out the Crimestopper report.
Show me the fucking tip.

765
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,833
- Why?
- Why not? What do you have to hide?

766
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:53,000
It's a Crimestopper tip.
It's not a state secret.

767
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:54,708
I-I don't have it.

768
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:56,125
Dude, why are you doing this?

769
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:57,541
- Hey, I don't have it.
- Where is it?

770
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:59,625
- I don't have it.
- In your car? At home? Where is it?

771
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,541
On your fucking thing? Where is it, man?

772
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:04,625
I would have never fucked you like this.

773
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,666
Motherfucker. Call the Major, or I will.

774
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,791
Do you think the cartel
would throw me a little loan, Numa?

775
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,666
You know, cover my nut?

776
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,500
Mmm. It don't hurt to ask, you know?

777
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,291
I heard they're pretty cool
about loaning money to cops.

778
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:15,083
I take home 80K a year after taxes.

779
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,583
And for that, I get…

780
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:21,708
shot at, spit on,
punched, kicked, insulted,

781
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,625
made to feel like a fucking piece of shit

782
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:27,458
for being a fucking sandbag
between chaos and civilized society.

783
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:32,166
Honestly, I feel like you put a little bit
of thought into them thoughts, Lolo.

784
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,125
What would you do with this, Numa?

785
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,083
Everything.

786
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,750
Just this.

787
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,666
This little money right here…

788
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,458
would make my life so much easier to live.

789
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:21,708
Hey, Dayo. Wrap these pricks up.
Let's get out of here.

790
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:23,041
I just started fucking with them.

791
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,666
No, fuck them. You know, fuck you
especially. I don't like you, asshole.

792
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:30,666
Good night. You have a good one.

793
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,083
- We'll see you later.
- Yeah, fuck you.

794
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,333
<i>Hey, Byrne-sy, where you at?</i>

795
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:38,333
Hey, man, we walked into a real one
tonight. I may need your help.

796
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,500
What's up?

797
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,500
We had a Crimestopper tip
come in after closing.

798
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:47,958
We ran it. Now I'm out here in Hialeah,
stuck in the shit.

799
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,000
<i>Stuck in the shit how?</i>

800
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,333
A Rip.

801
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:53,916
<i>More money</i>
<i>than you can fucking count.</i>

802
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,875
Fuck.

803
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,666
Yeah, and I'm worried about Dane, dude.

804
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,041
I don't know where his head is at.
He's not doing shit right.

805
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,208
What the hell does that mean?

806
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,083
Well, he hasn't called it in yet.

807
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,875
<i>The Rip? To Command?</i>

808
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:10,291
<i>Yeah.</i>

809
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:12,916
Well, that's no fucking good.

810
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:17,000
Is there anything
that you've heard about him?

811
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,541
<i>No, only that he's got a full head</i>
<i>of steam for solving Jackie's murder.</i>

812
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,958
Yeah… We all do. They were close.

813
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,833
<i>How close, J.D.?</i>

814
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,083
What are we talking about?

815
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:30,041
<i>J.D., you were in love.</i>

816
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:33,708
<i>You and Jackie had a thing, it was</i>
<i>the world's worst fucking kept secret.</i>

817
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:35,958
Yeah, we did.

818
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:38,541
Yeah, and you lost your promotion.

819
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:40,916
To Dane.

820
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,750
That wasn't personal.

821
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:45,166
<i>Says who?</i>

822
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,666
That just wasn't how Jackie did shit.

823
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,583
<i>- Says who?</i>
- Says me.

824
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,958
<i>Look, what if Jackie</i>
<i>was working that stash house,</i>

825
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,875
<i>the one you're on tonight, huh?</i>

826
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:55,291
<i>And what if Dane found out about that?</i>

827
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,583
Does that track? Is that possible?

828
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:03,708
I don't--
I mean, it's possible. It tracks.

829
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:06,166
<i>So ask yourself this.</i>

830
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,291
<i>Slowly.</i>

831
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,500
Live to see another sunrise.

832
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:14,708
<i>Is the size of that Rip</i>
<i>worth the price of a Miami police captain?</i>

833
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:18,375
No, Jesus Christ,
Dane didn't fucking kill Jackie.

834
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,250
<i>I'm just saying that the guy is broke.</i>

835
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,250
<i>He's in medical debt, his son is gone,</i>
<i>his marriage has imploded,</i>

836
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,958
<i>and we both know he's been on the mend</i>
<i>mentally for more than a minute.</i>

837
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:30,250
Yeah, watch your ten-year-old son
die of cancer, wouldn't you be?

838
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:33,416
<i>That's right, and only he knows</i>
<i>how that will fuck up your frame of mind.</i>

839
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,958
<i>But we all know</i>
<i>that he's never gonna truly recover,</i>

840
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:40,041
<i>which means that he's a man</i>
<i>that we can never truly trust.</i>

841
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:44,000
J.D., what do you have to lose
after you've lost everything?

842
00:48:46,083 --> 00:48:48,541
Fuck! All right,
I gotta talk to my brother.

843
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,666
Fuck that. Fuck the feds, don't do that.
Listen, I'm wrapping up right now.

844
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:57,458
Let me get to you. Ten minutes,
I will text you. Watch your back.

845
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:58,375
All right.

846
00:48:58,958 --> 00:48:59,791
Fuck.

847
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,166
Dayo, come here.

848
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:10,583
Who's gonna give a fuck?

849
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:13,916
Who's gonna miss
10, 20, 30 thousand dollars?

850
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,125
For real. Count this money,
make sure that shit is all here.

851
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:19,333
I'm not trying to fucking
be here all night.

852
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:22,666
Hey, guys, listen up.
I gotta run something by you, and…

853
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:25,958
Listen. If you're not down with it,
I understand.

854
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:27,583
But just between us…

855
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,375
I think we can make
something happen here. All right?

856
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,125
I know we're all thinking it,
so let's get realistic right now.

857
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:37,916
But I wanna get mine,
and I know you wanna get yours. All right?

858
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,916
I wanna get paid.

859
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,625
What's going on, Mike?

860
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,875
God… what the fuck.

861
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:18,666
Sarge, you can't creep up
on someone like that. Damn.

862
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,583
These lights is what's up.

863
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:23,625
What lights?

864
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,208
Those lights.

865
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,791
They all came on at once. It was like a…

866
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,750
on, like, a timer or something.

867
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,875
- On both sides of the street?
- Yeah.

868
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,875
Where are the people?

869
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,125
I haven't seen a soul.

870
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:39,833
Where are the cars?

871
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,916
You hear this bullshit about
the cartels buying up the housing blocks?

872
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,041
Let's not get into ghost stories, okay?

873
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:50,041
We got enough fucking problems right now.

874
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:53,541
Sarge.

875
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:55,750
We good in there?

876
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,750
Yeah. Relax. Everything's fine.

877
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:02,500
- It's all right.
- All right.

878
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:07,041
- Oh, shit. You see that?
- What?

879
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,958
Watch, watch. Right there, right there.

880
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:11,125
At first I thought it was,
like, electrical short,

881
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,916
but I think it's falling into a pattern.

882
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,500
Am I seeing shit?

883
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,083
No.

884
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,041
It is a pattern.

885
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,708
It's Morse code.

886
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,541
P-I…

887
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,291
G…

888
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:29,333
S.

889
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:31,750
They know we're here.

890
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,541
Yeah. Go let the lieutenant know.
I'm gonna check out that house.

891
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:37,875
You gonna go solo?

892
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:38,875
Yeah.

893
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:07,583
Hey, Lotta, it's L.T. I need the Major.

894
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,958
Major, hey, uh…

895
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,708
So we had a tip come in late.
House up in Hialeah.

896
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,875
Looks like the Rip's about 150K.

897
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:26,458
Nah, don't send SWAT.
We're not gonna need… We're QRU.

898
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,791
Yeah, we'll just…
we'll walk it out ourselves.

899
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:35,875
Just let me finish the count,
and I'll check back in. Yeah.

900
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:44,375
What the fuck am I gonna do?
What the fuck am I gonna do?

901
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,875
What the fuck am I gonna do?

902
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:48,625
What the fuck…?

903
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,125
Ro, they're gonna steal the money.

904
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,083
What? Who?

905
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,208
Yeah.

906
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:02,833
Your L.T., whatever,
and the other two, okay?

907
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:04,250
I heard them talking in the garage.

908
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:05,750
Wait, you heard them say this?

909
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,458
Yes. All right?

910
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:11,541
He called someone, a Major,
a higher command,

911
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,708
and he told them that there was
only $150,000 in this fucking house.

912
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,291
- Just now you heard them…
- Right before you walked in, okay?

913
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,583
You may be the only fucking person
we can trust, all right?

914
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,666
You gotta call somebody, anybody. Don't…

915
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,416
What are you doing inside, Detective?

916
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,500
Uh, Sarge sent me in to tell you
about this house up the street.

917
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,541
What house up the street?

918
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,416
He went to go check it out. They were…

919
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,333
It's looking like they were using
their porch lights to signal somebody.

920
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,791
Why don't we take a walk? You show me.

921
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,458
I want you to arrest me!

922
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:19,916
Take me to jail!

923
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,916
Please, get me the fuck out of here!

924
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,875
They're gonna fucking kill us!

925
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:33,166
Uncuff me! Please, fuck, let me go!

926
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,750
- Hello?
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

927
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:39,083
<i>People are gonna start dying</i>
<i>in ten minutes. Get the fuck out.</i>

928
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,666
Now, what were you and Desi discussing?

929
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:09,625
Nothing.

930
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,833
No, not nothing. That was a discussion.

931
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,208
She's scared. What do you expect?

932
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,125
Scared of what?

933
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:22,375
Us.

934
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,583
I think cops
make a lot of people nervous.

935
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,000
They make you nervous?

936
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,333
Sure. Some.

937
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,750
It's right there. It's that house.

938
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,333
The light keeps going on and off.
Sarge said it's Morse code.

939
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,333
It spells out "pigs"?

940
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:49,166
You get that, L.T.?

941
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:52,125
You a snitch, Mike?

942
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,625
You trying to rattle me?

943
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:01,750
I don't know.

944
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:07,958
You're not serious, L.T.

945
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,333
Why don't you head back to the house
and help 'em finish the count?

946
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,458
I'll handle the Sarge.

947
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:38,625
All right.

948
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:14,708
They're gonna rip the stash.
We need to move. Now!

949
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:07,291
Please get me out of here.

950
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:10,541
Hey, Desi, be cool, all right?

951
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:12,208
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
I won't let it.

952
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,291
Did you call someone?

953
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:16,250
I did. They're on their way. Stay calm.

954
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:23,708
Hey, it's Ro.

955
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:25,541
What the fuck is this?

956
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:35,166
Are these zip--
Why do you have zip ties on the door?

957
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,000
We don't want people coming in or out.

958
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,083
People? It's just us.

959
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:46,875
What are we doing here?

960
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,166
Counting.

961
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,500
I thought you were on the street.

962
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:53,625
I was.

963
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:55,833
They sent me back in to help.

964
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,958
We good. Lo, we good?

965
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:01,333
Yep. We've got a system now. Thank you.

966
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:04,458
It's looking like 20 mil?

967
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,250
Help me with this right there.

968
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:14,916
How are we looking?

969
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,208
We got a phone call.

970
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,041
Yeah? What'd they say?

971
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,875
That we had ten minutes
before we started dying,

972
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:22,958
and that was about five minutes ago.

973
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:24,250
How close are we on the count?

974
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,958
I know what the fuck you're doing.

975
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,583
Not further than five minutes.

976
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,416
All right, we gotta pick it up.
We gotta go.

977
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,791
What the fuck are you doing, man?
You gonna help?

978
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:37,791
Where's Sarge?

979
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,375
We got separated.

980
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:44,541
Find anything in that house?

981
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,500
No.

982
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:51,000
- Should I get him on the radio?
- Stay off the fucking radio.

983
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,458
All right, Maglites.
Get them low. Keep them low.

984
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:28,833
Fuck! Fuck! I got clipped.

985
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:29,958
Motherfucker!

986
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,416
Stay with Lolo, Numa! Stay with Lolo!

987
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,166
Mike! Mike! On me! On me!

988
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,375
Motherfuckers! They fucking got me!

989
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,541
I got you. I got you.

990
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:41,750
Come on.

991
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:44,500
Fuck.

992
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:48,291
We're not getting the power back.

993
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,333
Help me! Get me out of here!

994
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:52,375
We're gonna stop the bleeding.

995
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:55,916
Fuck. The cars.

996
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,208
Blood trail. Stay on me, Mike.

997
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:00,833
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Are you hit?

998
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:03,166
No! But please,
get me the fuck out of here!

999
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,541
We got a lot of real shit happening, okay?

1000
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,791
So if you don't have a bullet lodged
in your fucking body, please shut up!

1001
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,208
Fence, fence, fence!

1002
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:19,125
<i>Vamos, vamos.</i>

1003
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:26,750
You're fucking crazy!

1004
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,916
Desi! Is the dog okay?

1005
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,916
Where's the fucking dog?

1006
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,333
I can hear him but I can't see him.

1007
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:33,750
Wilbur!

1008
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:41,958
Wilbur!

1009
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,708
You guys are fucking crazy!

1010
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,625
- Wilbur!
- Get me the fuck out of here!

1011
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:47,083
Please shut the fuck up.

1012
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,708
Cover! Cover!

1013
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,291
Listen, I'm gonna uncuff you.

1014
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:05,333
Don't fuck me up, okay?
Find some candles. Get some light in here.

1015
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,041
I know what the fuck you're doing.

1016
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,791
- I'm breaking loose!
- Mike, move. I got the roof!

1017
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:50,416
Coming out!

1018
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,583
How many of these fucking guys
are out here?

1019
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,250
I don't fucking know.

1020
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:59,833
I'm pretty sure we got one of them.
There were three in the truck.

1021
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:01,958
Goddamn.

1022
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,750
Hey, down! Down! Get the fuck down!

1023
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,083
Down! Get down!

1024
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:07,375
Down! Down! Get the fuck down!

1025
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,000
Get down! Down! Get the fuck down!

1026
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:12,666
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!
Hey! Hey! He's cool.

1027
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:13,833
What the fuck do you mean, he's cool?

1028
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,000
It's not him. He's the guy in the porch.
He's on look-out.

1029
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,125
What does he mean, it's not us?

1030
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,250
It's the guy from the porch light.
He's cartel.

1031
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,666
- They weren't the ones who fucking hit us.
- Who the fuck did?

1032
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,000
I don't know.

1033
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:23,958
Okay, <i>claro.</i>

1034
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,291
Yo, what are you doing? What's he doing?

1035
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:28,291
He's calling his boss. Calm down.

1036
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,416
<i>You need to remember that I'm up here</i>

1037
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,541
<i>and you're down there.</i>

1038
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,791
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

1039
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:47,541
Damn it.

1040
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:06,333
<i>Let me tell you,</i>
<i>since it is likely being recorded,</i>

1041
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:08,291
<i>none of our members</i>

1042
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:11,708
<i>had anything to do with</i>
<i>whoever attacked you violently tonight.</i>

1043
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:14,583
<i>We also have no interest in the money</i>

1044
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,875
<i>that may have been discovered</i>
<i>in that house.</i>

1045
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,791
Are you aware of the amount of money?

1046
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:22,791
<i>That's of no importance.</i>

1047
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:25,333
<i>This is the chess game we play.</i>

1048
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:27,583
<i>And tonight you are the winner.</i>

1049
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:30,125
<i>And we don't want more</i>
<i>dead police officers.</i>

1050
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:34,541
<i>The captain who was killed</i>
<i>has already hurt our business enough.</i>

1051
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:38,625
Did the cartel have anything
to do with the murder of Captain Velez?

1052
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:46,000
<i>Good luck, Detectives.</i>

1053
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:48,083
<i>You will need a lot of it tonight.</i>

1054
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:55,125
What's going on?

1055
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,083
- Let's go.
- He said…

1056
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:00,291
they're abandoning the stash house.

1057
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,333
He said it wasn't them that attacked us.

1058
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,125
That's not all he fucking said.

1059
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:07,291
They're fucking walking away
from $20 million?

1060
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:09,208
Killing a cop is expensive.

1061
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,791
Killing five of us bankrupts
even the best dope game.

1062
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,125
These guys aren't stupid.

1063
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,416
At the end of the day,
20 million is a write-off.

1064
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,541
Lolo, you good?

1065
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:27,791
Yeah, boss, I'm good. I'm fine.

1066
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:29,666
Guys, the cartel didn't hit us.

1067
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:33,208
It wasn't them, and they're doing
a quitclaim. They're walking away.

1068
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:43,875
So if they don't want the money,
it's anybody's ball, yeah?

1069
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:48,833
What does that mean?

1070
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:52,750
Vouch what was in the Crimestopper.

1071
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,458
What about the rest?

1072
01:05:56,166 --> 01:06:00,291
I mean, you want to be a thief, Lolo?
Commit. Come on, say it.

1073
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,000
Are you gonna pay
child support for my girls?

1074
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,708
Is this the example
you want to set for them?

1075
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,625
What does it matter…
I took a bullet for this money.

1076
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:12,291
You already called the Major, yeah, boss?

1077
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:15,000
Yeah.

1078
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:16,500
Yeah, when?

1079
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:22,250
Earlier.

1080
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:26,833
Yeah, I told him about the Rip,

1081
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,000
told him we were going to finish
the count, walk it out ourselves.

1082
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:31,500
With what? Our cars are fucking trashed.

1083
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,125
Call an SRT, get a retrieval team.

1084
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,791
- Are you assuming command now, J.D.?
- Where's the printout?

1085
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,208
Fuck the printout.

1086
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:45,625
There was no fucking Crimestopper report.
Just so you know, he made it up.

1087
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:47,500
To get us out here
to steal this fucking Rip.

1088
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,875
You were Jackie's second-in-command.
She knew about it. You knew about it, too.

1089
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:56,041
- Easy, motherfucker.
- Who's out there, Dane?

1090
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,666
Who just hit us right now?

1091
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:00,291
You part of some
fucking asshole, corrupt cop team

1092
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:03,291
- knocking over stash houses like this?
- Hey. What about you, man?

1093
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:04,625
- What about me?
- Huh?

1094
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:07,750
The fucking ex-VCAT detective
that you recognized.

1095
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:11,125
Shit started to get real weird after that
guy showed up. It's been weird ever since.

1096
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:13,125
You think I'm lying in the cut
with that fucking cunt?

1097
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:16,458
And then you disappear
for, what, 30-odd minutes

1098
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:19,625
and come back
with an armed cartel lookout?

1099
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,083
Did you shoot up the garage, man?

1100
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:24,000
Pick a lane, Dane.

1101
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,791
Either I'm mobbed up with the fucking cops
or I'm running with the cartel.

1102
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:28,625
And your own fucking brother,
a federal agent…

1103
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:29,708
Uh-huh?

1104
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:31,666
…keeps circling back, questioning you.
You, man.

1105
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,666
- Why?
- That is the weakest shit I've ever heard,

1106
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,541
so let me put
my fucking foot through it right now.

1107
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:40,541
So when we're all getting deposed,
you remember this fucking moment.

1108
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:46,708
What did Mr. Cartel say on the phone
about Jackie?

1109
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:55,166
"Our people think she was killed

1110
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,833
by a member of her own team."

1111
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:07,583
- You kill Jackie, Dane?
- Oh, fuck you, man. Fuck off.

1112
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:10,833
You want to steal this Rip, Dane.
Just say it out loud.

1113
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,458
L.T., come on.

1114
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:21,000
I just figured it out
why you don't like being a cop.

1115
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:22,458
'Cause you're not a fucking cop.

1116
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,250
You're a fucking
piece of shit cop-killer…

1117
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:28,833
No, stop it!

1118
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:34,000
Stop it, guys. What are you…
What the fuck are you doing?

1119
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,125
Oh, my God. Stop!

1120
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,791
Stop it! Stop! Get off!

1121
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,000
- Break it up!
- Stop!

1122
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:51,416
Get the fuck off me!

1123
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Fuck you!

1124
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:01,208
- Just go!
- Fuck you.

1125
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:13,125
We finish the count. Now.

1126
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,166
We get the money,
we get the fuck out of here.

1127
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:18,041
Hey, go sit with her.
She does not move.

1128
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,125
Are we arresting her?

1129
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:21,875
- What the fuck did I just say?
- All right!

1130
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,541
- When did you hear the word "arrest"?
- All right!

1131
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:25,875
Come on.

1132
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,583
Let's just go, girl.
Let's get this shit wrapped up, okay?

1133
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:31,041
It's been a long fucking night.
We're good.

1134
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:33,541
Just watch her and let's wrap this up.

1135
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:40,625
- They're gonna kill us, aren't they?
- It's gonna be all right.

1136
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:42,791
You have to help.
You're the only good one!

1137
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:17,750
Yo, Matty. Dane's doing the Rip.

1138
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,791
He's gone rogue, man.
You gotta fucking get here.

1139
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:21,125
We're inbound now.

1140
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,875
You got the full kick, whole team?

1141
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:25,791
<i>No. Had to cut my starters loose.</i>
<i>Can't afford the fucking overtime.</i>

1142
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:26,875
Fuck.

1143
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:28,833
Listen, I've got an armored Lenco.
We're good.

1144
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:33,541
I want to get to that armored count room
you guys set up by Jackson Memorial.

1145
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:35,416
<i>J.D., how much you sitting on?</i>

1146
01:10:35,916 --> 01:10:37,166
I'm staring at over 20 mil.

1147
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,500
You shitting me?

1148
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:42,041
<i>No, I am not.</i>

1149
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:44,958
<i>So get here fast as you fucking can</i>
<i>before somebody gets killed.</i>

1150
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:48,458
You just fucking hang on.
We're right there. We're right there.

1151
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,416
Desi. Hey. Hey.

1152
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,333
Listen, I had a burner in there.
A hidden phone.

1153
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:09,625
I think I lost it
when I was breaking up their fight.

1154
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:12,083
You don't have a phone that you use
to contact the cartel, do you?

1155
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,041
No, your boss took it from me, remember?

1156
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:15,750
Fuck!

1157
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,166
That's it. That's all of them.

1158
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:27,666
80 pounds apiece. Bullet-proofed.

1159
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:39,666
All right, Numa.

1160
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:42,875
This is the number. Don't say it out loud.

1161
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:45,333
- Got it.
- All right, Lolo.

1162
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,958
- Tell me when you got it.
- Okay.

1163
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,208
- I got it.
- Okay.

1164
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,041
Don't answer it.

1165
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,583
How are we getting this money
out of here, boss?

1166
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:05,500
- All the cars fucked up? Like, done?
- All of them.

1167
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:09,000
- See if Desi has the keys?
- You think it runs?

1168
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,291
I mean, it's shot to shit, but…

1169
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,750
Oh, shit! We're on fire!

1170
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:16,750
Get the bags.

1171
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,750
All right. We'll come back for the rest.

1172
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,000
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

1173
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,375
You all right?

1174
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:42,833
Oh, my God, the house.
The house is fucking burning.

1175
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,333
The house is fucking burning!
Is anyone calling anyone?

1176
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:48,375
Only here to help. What can I do?

1177
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,583
All right, let's load the money bags
into the back of the Lenco.

1178
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:01,708
Numa, you stay here.
I want you to stay with Desi.

1179
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,791
- Wait for Fire and Rescue.
- No, boss, I'm fine. Let's go.

1180
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:06,208
No, we've been breathing in
a lot of smoke in there.

1181
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:07,291
Boss, I said I'm fine.

1182
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,958
I'm not gonna fucking
argue with you about this.

1183
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,083
- I want you to stay here.
- No, no, no.

1184
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:14,208
You're not fucking going anywhere.
We're done.

1185
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:16,833
- Hey, no, you are staying on site.
- Shut the fuck up.

1186
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:19,333
Hey. Listen to me.
You stay with me and the money.

1187
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:21,125
- You called Nix, motherfucker?
- I don't take orders from you.

1188
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:23,250
- No, no. I'm fucking in charge!
- You're finished. You hear me?

1189
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,458
- Fuck you!
- What the fuck are you two doing?

1190
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:28,291
Just fucking load in.
What the fuck's wrong with you two?

1191
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:30,541
So that's it? You're gonna burn us, boss?

1192
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:32,416
That's it? You're just gonna
take the fucking money?

1193
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:36,958
And what about
my grandmother's house? It's burning.

1194
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,916
In case anything jumps…

1195
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:31,291
I don't want to worry
about clearing my weapon.

1196
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:00,208
Where are we taking this money?

1197
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:03,833
DEA-held Wells Fargo near the hospital.

1198
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:13,250
What are you doing?

1199
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:18,000
I'm calling the Major.
I'll let him know to meet us at the bank.

1200
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:20,958
Dane already let him know,
didn't you, Dane?

1201
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:25,291
Yeah, he's aware.

1202
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:27,375
No, he's not.

1203
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,791
He knows about the Rip,
but not the total amount.

1204
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:36,166
How would you know that?

1205
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:44,000
You know, you never
answered my question from earlier.

1206
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,291
Are you a snitch?

1207
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:50,291
L.T., why don't you go fuck yourself?
That's my answer.

1208
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:51,708
Hey, everybody, calm down.

1209
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:53,458
People are tired.
It's been a long fucking night.

1210
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:57,333
Now it's about to get a lot longer.

1211
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:59,666
Dane, Ro is not Internal Affairs.

1212
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:00,916
I didn't say he was IA.

1213
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:04,416
He's snitching for someone else.

1214
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:06,791
Who's moving on this money?

1215
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:09,291
You mean the money
you've been trying to steal all night?

1216
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:14,291
That girl Desi told me that you
told the Major that the Rip was only 150k.

1217
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:16,458
That's right.
Did it sound something like this?

1218
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,750
"Hello, Major. This is Dumars."

1219
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:20,791
<i>"Yeah, we took a tip late</i>
<i>on a house in Hialeah."</i>

1220
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:22,916
<i>"The Rip looks like it's about 150k."</i>

1221
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,750
<i>"No, don't send SRT.</i>
<i>We're gonna walk it out ourselves."</i>

1222
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,625
"We're gonna finish the count,
and I'll check back in."

1223
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,833
Is that what she heard?

1224
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:31,541
She told me that you were planning on
boosting that money with Numa and Lolo.

1225
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,166
That's what she told me.

1226
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,750
Detective, that girl heard me saying

1227
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:38,250
exactly what I wanted her to hear me say.

1228
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,958
Hey, guys, listen up.

1229
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,833
I got something I gotta run by you.
All right? Now…

1230
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:48,208
If you're not down with it, I understand.

1231
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:51,791
I'll deny that I ever said it.
But just between us…

1232
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,625
I think we can
make something happen here.

1233
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:56,708
All right? I wanna get paid.

1234
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:00,666
- I wanna rob the Rip.
- Let's do it.

1235
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,500
All right. Now, listen.

1236
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:05,083
I knew she'd tell you
about me and Numa and Lolo.

1237
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,583
Ro, they're gonna steal the money.

1238
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,791
<i>Because she trusted you.</i>

1239
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,583
<i>You looked the part.</i>

1240
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:16,666
I also knew she'd tell you about the Major
and the phone call and the 150K.

1241
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:19,875
That wasn't the first time
you heard that number, though, was it?

1242
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:25,833
That's the number I gave you back at HQ
when you asked me about the Rip.

1243
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,541
- Yeah. You did. And…?
- And…

1244
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:33,291
he told me it was 300K.

1245
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:37,458
I told Numa it was 250.

1246
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,041
I told Lolo it was 75.

1247
01:17:40,916 --> 01:17:44,875
The only person
who ever heard 150K was you.

1248
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:46,958
And whoever called the house.

1249
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:49,666
What are you talking about?

1250
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:56,041
The voice on the phone said,
"Take the 150K and leave."

1251
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,791
<i>No one needs to die over 150K.</i>

1252
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,583
How much is this Rip supposed to be?

1253
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:00,583
150K.

1254
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:04,708
- 150K. Exact.
- Now, where'd he get that number?

1255
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:07,583
So I called the fucking house? How's that?

1256
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,791
I was standing right there.
You took my phone.

1257
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,208
You've been using a burner all night.

1258
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:13,916
I don't have a fucking burner.
I don't have a 33 on me.

1259
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,250
What's this, Mike?

1260
01:18:23,708 --> 01:18:26,250
- I don't know. That's not mine.
- You've never seen it before? Yeah.

1261
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,583
Well, that's strange, because
that's the burner he took off you

1262
01:18:28,666 --> 01:18:31,208
- when we were fighting in the garage.
- Yep. That's where I got it.

1263
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,791
Get the fuck off me!

1264
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,875
But don't worry.
There's an easy way to solve it.

1265
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:38,625
We'll just see if your face unlocks
the fucking phone. Let's test it out.

1266
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:41,833
- Guys, what are we doing here?
- What are you doing?

1267
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,791
- You called in those Hialeah cops.
- What?

1268
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:46,666
- You set fire to the stash house.
- Are you hearing this bullshit?

1269
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,333
You've been trying
to steal this Rip all night.

1270
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:51,916
See, the thing about lying, Detective,

1271
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,125
it becomes real hard to keep
those timelines straight.

1272
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:57,541
Who did what? Who did it when?
The truth is much more of a straight line.

1273
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,666
- Okay.
- Unless…

1274
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,875
you're lying like me.

1275
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:03,833
The way I've been lying to you
all night long

1276
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:07,500
because then, truth be told,
it is a fucking art form.

1277
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:13,791
Don't feel bad. I've been bullshitting
everybody all night. Even him.

1278
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,500
Till recently.

1279
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:17,291
Till just recently.

1280
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:31,833
You got something you want to tell me?

1281
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,416
- There never was any Crimestopper tip.
- No shit.

1282
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,000
I got this from a burner
the night she was killed.

1283
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:45,958
Jackie sent this?

1284
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:49,666
You put this whole thing in play
on purpose?

1285
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,291
You gave me the idea.

1286
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,916
Bloody up the water,
see what rides to the surface.

1287
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Well, why didn't you fucking tell me?

1288
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,916
The only way to get everybody
to believe I'd actually steal the money

1289
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,916
is if you believed it.

1290
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,833
…fuckin' money…

1291
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,958
<i>I made up the Crimestopper tip</i>
<i>to get all of us to the address she sent</i>

1292
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:05,625
<i>so we could see for ourselves.</i>

1293
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:08,666
<i>And maybe whoever killed her</i>
<i>would make a play.</i>

1294
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,916
But J.D., man. The heist teams…

1295
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:14,458
- I think she was closing in.
- She was gonna use this Rip as bait.

1296
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:16,750
But they killed her
before she could put it in motion.

1297
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:17,958
Who?

1298
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:19,833
We're gonna find out tonight.

1299
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,541
But Mike Ro's with 'em.

1300
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:26,833
I had you from the second I heard "150K".

1301
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:30,416
Just needed to know
who you were working with.

1302
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:33,750
Where are the radios, Matty?

1303
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:35,833
- What?
- The radios?

1304
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:41,500
Why haven't we heard any pops?
Anything from dispatch? Any call-outs?

1305
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:48,291
We're taking $20 million across
North Miami. Who's fucking monitoring us?

1306
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:51,208
It's just us. Airtight, low-key.

1307
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:54,625
Why couldn't you bring
the BearCats out, Matty?

1308
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:55,750
Couldn't get them approved.

1309
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:56,833
Hmm.

1310
01:20:57,333 --> 01:21:00,041
Yeah, where's your regular chalk?
Pop Squad?

1311
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:01,291
Where are those guys?
Where's Dayo?

1312
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:02,625
I sent him home.

1313
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:05,541
Again, no approval, zero overtime.
What is this, a fucking mystery?

1314
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:07,250
I told you how much was in the Rip.

1315
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:10,958
You also told me Dane was dirty
and might be wanting to steal it.

1316
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:12,416
Or I was acting like I did

1317
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,833
to see who'd actually show up
and try to steal it.

1318
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,666
What are the odds
the Tahoe back there's got

1319
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:22,916
one or both of those Hialeah cops
we beefed with earlier?

1320
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,041
Who's driving up front, man?
Anybody we know?

1321
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,541
- It was you who called the house.
- And shot it up.

1322
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,625
What the fuck is this?

1323
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:36,166
What the fuck is this?

1324
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:39,208
You trying to "two-and-two-is-four" me,
run up the flank? Fuck you both.

1325
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,416
Mike.

1326
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,541
Last chance, man. Make it count.

1327
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,958
Who else is moving on the money?

1328
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:57,750
You think I'm bent?

1329
01:21:58,916 --> 01:21:59,875
Okay.

1330
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,166
Can I see that burner, Sarge?

1331
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:22,708
Redial.

1332
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:50,750
No!

1333
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:56,583
Down, down! Get down!

1334
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:02,208
You stay the fuck down!

1335
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:13,833
All right. We're fucking made.

1336
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,750
The move's out there.
It's all out in the fucking open now,

1337
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,333
so let's do something about it.

1338
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:21,166
We're good!

1339
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:23,916
We got something
we're working out in here.

1340
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,208
Get Dayo out of the front seat!

1341
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:36,708
Don't do any dumb shit, Detective.

1342
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,375
Nix, where the fuck am I going, man?

1343
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:54,708
This is fucking more money
than any one of us could ever spend.

1344
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,916
We mob up, we disappear in an hour…

1345
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,583
We live like kings the rest of our lives.

1346
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:01,916
Except for this dumb fuck!

1347
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,666
You're gonna ride for the team, you fuck!

1348
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:07,041
Touch that gun, and I will kill you, J.D.

1349
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,375
I will fucking put a hole
right between your eyes.

1350
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:12,750
Nix, I have no fucking idea
where I'm going!

1351
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,583
What about Jackie?

1352
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:16,291
Did you kill her, Matty?

1353
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:18,666
Ro killed her!

1354
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:22,000
Fuck you, I did. Fuck you, I did.

1355
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:23,083
You shut the fuck up!

1356
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:26,541
You fucking pulled the trigger,
you fuck! You finished her!

1357
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:44,750
You finished her, you fuck!
You finished her!

1358
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:47,958
- Okay, let's focus.
- I gotta get this rig off the road, man!

1359
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,583
I can get fucking right.

1360
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:56,458
- What the fuck is that?
- You're gonna want me to take this.

1361
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:09,250
Go ahead. You're on speaker.

1362
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,916
<i>Just got into position.</i>

1363
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,166
<i>Is that you</i>
<i>coming up the street right now?</i>

1364
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,208
<i>The Lenco, Tahoe behind you?</i>

1365
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:28,541
- Yep, that's us. Where are you?
<i>- We're right here.</i>

1366
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,583
- Fucking… Who the fuck is that?
- It's my brother.

1367
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:44,750
Nix, what the fuck are we doing now?

1368
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:48,875
<i>This is Special Agent Del Byrne</i>
<i>of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>

1369
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:53,000
I need everyone to exit the back
of the vehicle with your hands raised.

1370
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:55,125
It's over.

1371
01:25:56,458 --> 01:25:58,833
- Put the gun down, man.
- Nix, I'm out.

1372
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:01,666
We're done. It's the feds.
It's the fucking feds out there.

1373
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,125
Here's what we're gonna do.

1374
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:07,791
We worked this thing together,
joint-agency, DEA and Dade, yeah?

1375
01:26:08,291 --> 01:26:10,958
We took out the heist team, Ro,

1376
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:15,500
those Hialeah fucks, fucking ex-VCAT.

1377
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:18,166
This writes itself, guys.

1378
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:23,375
I repeat. Exit the back
of the vehicle with your hands raised.

1379
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:24,791
It's not gonna work, Nix.

1380
01:26:24,875 --> 01:26:27,291
It's the fucking feds out there.
They're fucking everywhere.

1381
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:31,208
The fact is, no one wants this scandal.
No one needs more headlines. Instead,

1382
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:34,041
we fucking look like heroes.

1383
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:37,083
We took $20 million from the cartel

1384
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:39,500
and we're gonna gift it back
to the city of Miami?

1385
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:42,583
Let's think about this.

1386
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:45,291
This could be beautiful for us.

1387
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:48,958
Matty, they can hear you.

1388
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:51,583
I said, "You're on speaker."

1389
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,208
<i>Agent Nix, how would you like this to go?</i>

1390
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:57,625
- Fuck!
- Ro, stop!

1391
01:26:57,708 --> 01:27:00,333
Get down, get down! Shit! No!

1392
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,291
Get on the ground now!

1393
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:05,708
- No, Mike, no!
- Ro!

1394
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:11,916
Shit!

1395
01:27:22,666 --> 01:27:23,875
Take that rig!

1396
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:47,875
- Hands, hands!
- Where? Where'd he go?

1397
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:55,333
Hey! Hey, J.D.!

1398
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:59,166
J.D.! That's my fucking car, man!

1399
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:25,166
Fuck.

1400
01:29:19,666 --> 01:29:20,625
Fuck you!

1401
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:48,083
Oof!

1402
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:54,708
Fuck!

1403
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:35,458
Stop.

1404
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:39,083
Mike!

1405
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,666
Stop it.

1406
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,750
Fuck.

1407
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,083
Fuck! Fuck!

1408
01:32:28,166 --> 01:32:29,291
Goddamn it, Mike.

1409
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:34,916
Do you think I'm a piece of shit?

1410
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:38,000
What amount of money?

1411
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:41,208
What fucking amount of money?
I will cut you in. Huh?

1412
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:42,666
Let's work here. Come on.

1413
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:44,041
How much you got?

1414
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:47,083
Price of a Miami police captain?

1415
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:56,500
You get it now?

1416
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,541
Are you gonna execute me?

1417
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:17,583
It's moving fast, man.

1418
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:22,250
Wake up one day,

1419
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:24,625
you're old.

1420
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,791
Let's go.

1421
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:25,333
- Okay, sign off on this here.
- Got it.

1422
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,250
There has to be like… at least…

1423
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:33,333
Hey, they're on my ass.
I need that number.

1424
01:36:33,416 --> 01:36:34,250
Got it.

1425
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,791
- Detective Salazar?
- Yeah.

1426
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:41,166
You have verbal confirmation
of your count?

1427
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:42,375
Yes.

1428
01:36:43,458 --> 01:36:44,500
Yes.

1429
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,208
20,650,480.

1430
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:54,875
Detective Baptiste.

1431
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:56,625
You have a number for me?

1432
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:59,541
20,650,480.

1433
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:04,666
Lieutenant Dumars.

1434
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:06,750
You have written confirmation
of your count?

1435
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:07,916
Yep. Got it.

1436
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:33,416
Hey, good evening.

1437
01:37:34,541 --> 01:37:35,666
Or morning.

1438
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,333
You'll be happy with that.

1439
01:37:52,125 --> 01:37:53,166
{\an8}Wow.

1440
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:56,166
To the dollar.

1441
01:37:57,458 --> 01:38:00,125
Well done, Detectives. Well done.

1442
01:38:05,166 --> 01:38:06,458
That's one solid Rip.

1443
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:09,625
Clear this place out. Mop it up.

1444
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:10,875
Roger that.

1445
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:14,375
Did he just say "one solid Rip"?

1446
01:38:29,125 --> 01:38:30,375
- Holy shit.
- Oh, boy.

1447
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:32,083
She's getting a piece
of the fucking seizure.

1448
01:38:32,166 --> 01:38:33,083
Oh, my God.

1449
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:34,333
- Wow.
- Well, shit, good for her.

1450
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:38,166
Her <i>abuela's </i>house
burnt down. She can have it.

1451
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,791
Well, babies, we did it. We did that shit.

1452
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:42,666
- Yeah, we did.
- Yes, we fucking did.

1453
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:46,500
You guys were great.
You guys were just great.

1454
01:38:47,041 --> 01:38:48,000
Jackie'd be proud.

1455
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:50,583
I really feel like
she made that happen from beyond.

1456
01:38:50,666 --> 01:38:52,208
She had that <i>bruja </i>thing.

1457
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:54,666
All right.

1458
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:57,125
- Yeah.
- I'm about to blow this popsicle stand.

1459
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:59,833
I got a real hot shower
and a big-ass empty bed

1460
01:38:59,916 --> 01:39:02,458
that is waiting for big mama
to get home. I gotta go.

1461
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,583
Mm!

1462
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,875
- My leg…
- All right, get some rest.

1463
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:11,208
I'll see you guys.

1464
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:13,208
- Go see the girls.
- All right, how you getting home?

1465
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:14,125
- Bye.
- You take care.

1466
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:16,333
Oh, you ain't heard?
DEA's putting us in Uber.

1467
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:19,375
Uber Black, to be exact.
Real classy shit, you know?

1468
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:20,875
Bye, boss.

1469
01:39:21,458 --> 01:39:22,333
- Say hi to the girls.
- I'm tired.

1470
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:23,291
I will.

1471
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:25,833
Let's go, papa.

1472
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:29,541
She get 20% of that Rip.
That's four million dollars.

1473
01:39:30,166 --> 01:39:31,333
Yeah, looks like it.

1474
01:39:31,416 --> 01:39:33,583
I mean, the IRS
is gonna take half of it, right?

1475
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:36,458
But yeah, she'll do all right.
Not a bad night's work.

1476
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:38,708
Yeah. If you can fucking get it.

1477
01:39:38,791 --> 01:39:40,750
Yeah.

1478
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:43,875
Congratulations, Del. Did your job.

1479
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:47,791
Yeah, I did. Did your job too,
motherfucker. Thank me later.

1480
01:39:48,291 --> 01:39:50,958
Hey. I'm sorry about yesterday.

1481
01:39:51,041 --> 01:39:52,375
I'm sorry. I said it.

1482
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:54,625
- What, you want… You want a hug?
- Yeah, I want a hug.

1483
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:56,416
- No, I'm not hugging you.
- Give your big brother a hug.

1484
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,541
- I'm not hugging you, J.D.
- Hug your big brother who loves you.

1485
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:00,333
Back up. No chance. Get fucked.

1486
01:40:00,416 --> 01:40:04,041
Come on. Hey, hug your brother
who loves you in front of all the feds.

1487
01:40:04,125 --> 01:40:06,291
Come here. He's a bully, but he loves you.

1488
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,208
You're a fucking asshole, you know that?

1489
01:40:08,291 --> 01:40:10,125
- You're an asshole too, but I love you.
- Yeah?

1490
01:40:10,791 --> 01:40:12,500
- All right. Thanks, man.
- You okay, though?

1491
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:14,041
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1492
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:16,833
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1493
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:21,041
Hey, I'm gonna stop by Mom's later
for a cup of coffee,

1494
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:24,708
and just so you know, I'm gonna
take credit for fucking everything.

1495
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:25,875
- Oh, I know.
- All of it.

1496
01:40:25,958 --> 01:40:27,375
- Why change? Yeah.
- Yeah.

1497
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:28,708
And you owe me a new car too.

1498
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:29,958
All right.

1499
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:33,000
Congratulations, kid.
Don't spend it all in one place.

1500
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:33,916
Thanks.

1501
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:37,416
Stop fucking around. I know you got
beer around here somewhere.

1502
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:43,791
Thank you.

1503
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:48,416
You knew I'd tell Ro everything,
didn't you?

1504
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,125
Yeah, yeah.
I knew you'd do the right thing,

1505
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:54,125
even if it put you in danger.

1506
01:40:58,125 --> 01:40:59,208
That, um…

1507
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:04,083
That captain, that policewoman
that was murdered,

1508
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:05,791
the one that I talked to…

1509
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:08,333
- Jackie.
- Yeah, Jackie.

1510
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,208
I don't know.
Through all this shit, she got us to you.

1511
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:16,666
- Is that weird to you?
- No, no.

1512
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:18,791
And if you knew Jackie…

1513
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:21,583
She'd…

1514
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:24,291
She'd say it was meant to happen that way.

1515
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:27,875
Then maybe it was.

1516
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:29,750
Yeah.

1517
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,875
Oh, you wanna know what they mean.

1518
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:42,541
"Are we the good guys?"

1519
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:51,166
Last thing, uh, my son said to me.

1520
01:41:56,333 --> 01:41:57,666
"We are and always will be."

1521
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:04,791
Last thing I said to my son.

1522
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:10,500
How?

1523
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:14,958
Cancer, uh…

1524
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,500
He was ten years old. Jake.

1525
01:42:27,083 --> 01:42:31,125
All right, Desiree Lopez Molina.
Stay the fuck out of trouble.

1526
01:43:07,916 --> 01:43:09,625
Great work today, man.

1527
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:12,416
You, too.

1528
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:46,625
Look at the sunrise!

1529
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:51,500
So pretty!

1530
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:53,250
Imagine being that fired up for a sunrise.

1531
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:55,666
That's great. That's great.

1532
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:05,583
Jackie!

1533
01:44:12,166 --> 01:44:14,208
Jackie, where are you, baby?

1534
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,166
I'm right here!
