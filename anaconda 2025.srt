- Think I'm gonna miss this? Never.
- Oh.

175
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,955
We got a lot of catching up to do.

176
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:45,752
Many years ago, a group of young,
passionate artists had a vision.

177
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:51,466
It was a vision that's not
particularly original or even, uh, good...

178
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,510
- [guests chuckle]
- ...but it was theirs.

179
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,930
And so they made that vision a reality.

180
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,558
And, without further ado,

181
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:04,688
I present to you
a completely unrestored print

182
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,818
of 13-year-old Doug McCallister's
masterpiece, <i>The Quatch</i>.

183
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,736

184
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,863
What? I thought we lost
all the copies of that!

185
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:13,947
- No way.
- Nope.

186
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,825
I found it in my mom's garage.
It was stuck in the player.

187
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,244
Are we sure this is okay
for the kids to watch?

188
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,537
Who gives a shit?

189
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,665
Mrs. Brown had us bleep all the swears so
we could show it at the school assembly.

190
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:24,958
Yeah, which didn't make much sense

191
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,586
because we were very clear
about it being R-rated.

192
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,172
- Happy birthday, pal.
- [laughs] This isn't happening.

193

194

- God.
- Here, sit.

00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,095
Oh, I'm gonna kill you. [gasps]

the ear for it, did we?

208

214
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,969
So much charisma. Already, you had it.

215
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,555
I still can't believe I let Doug talk me
into doing that.

216
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,391

That was your idea.

That's probably the best birthday gift
I've ever received.

232
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,807
- I didn't even know it existed.
- Well, I'm giving it to you.

233
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,892
Plus the TV 'cause you can't get it out.

- Yay!
- Yes!

00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,110
- It was right after, you know...
- Right after senior year of college.

236
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,488
Yes, that's when <i>Anaconda</i> came out.
Remember? We saw it like 30 times.

237
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,449
Put it right there alongside the classics.

238
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,409
Totally. How about that cast? Come on.

239
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,996
- J.Lo, Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, Stoltz.
- Oh, for sure.

240
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,289
I mean, it's a murderers' row.

241
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:32,127

for our lives at that moment.

- [Doug] No, that's true.

- [Doug] It was like that.

- Whatever.

Apparently, the movie was based
on a novel by some dead Japanese guy.

259
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:29,267
And my agent introduced me to his widow.

260

Unbelievably, she was such a fan of the
four episodes that I did on <i>S.W.A.T...</i>

I nursed him back to life,

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,755

There are rumors of 'condas even bigger.

Maybe four or five times this size.

Um, is it true that
they regurgitate their prey?

501
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,354
Um, sometimes.

502
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,315
I mean, if you're lucky,

503
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,401
you'd die right away because of...
[groans] ...suffocation.

But only the unlucky ones survive.

Unlucky?

506
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,371
Yeah, because then
you might actually be conscious

when the snake comes back
to finish you off.

- [music stops]
- [patrons chattering]

514
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,952
[tense music playing]

515
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,204
[thuds]

516
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,377
Hey. Let me ask you a question.

517
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,754
- Um, our snake guy...
- Mmm?

518
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,924
Does he seem kind of batshit crazy?

519
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,468
I mean, he's best friends with a snake.

520
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,928
- Of course he's a little quirky.
- Yeah.

521
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,012
But I like him.

522
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:55,930
- Really?
- Yeah.

523
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,014
But then again,

524
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,141
I used up all my vacation days

525
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,436
to come make a self-financed snake movie
with you three, so...

526
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,647
- Yeah, your judgment is really off.
- My judgment is off.

527
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,773
- It always has been.
- Exactly.

528
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,817
[Doug] Anybody talk to the captain?
It's time to shoot.

529
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,986
I'll, uh, reach out again, boss.

530
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:10,903
- [Doug exclaims]
- [chuckles]

531
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,072
Hi, guys. My name is Ana.

532
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,991
I believe you spoke
to my father on the phone?

533
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,159
Bruno? That's your dad?

534
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,078
Yeah, he sends his apologies,

535
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,330
- but he's at the hospital.
- Oh.

536
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,707
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- [Ana] Unfortunately,

537
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,625
you'll have to make other accommodations,

538
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,837
'cause I need to take this boat upriver
for a routine service.

539
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,380
But I can assure you a full refund.

540
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,423
No, wait. Wait.

541
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,425
- Everything else is booked.
- [Griff] Yeah.

542
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,302
And-- And w-we're gonna shoot a movie.

543
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,012
It's a reboot of <i>Anaconda</i>.

544
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,014
Technically,
it's more of a reimagining, but--

545
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,974
It's actually more of a spiritual sequel.

546
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,142
Good for you.

547
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,185
- There's gotta be a way, right?
- We can crew the boat.

548
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,270
There's nothing I can do...

549
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,732
We have dreamed of making
this film together our entire lives.

550
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,192
Please. I am begging you.

551
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,236
- Please.
- Help us find another way.

552
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,030
- Let's do this, but fast.
- [Doug] Okay.

553
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,531
- [Claire] Yes! Let's go!
- Thank you!

554
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,618
[upbeat music playing]

555
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,375
[clanking, whirring]

556
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:17,720
[Griff] Whoo!

557
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,680
- Oh!
- [Griff] Wow!

558
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:20,765
Yes!

559
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,767
This is so beautiful.

560
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,769
This is amazing. It's amazing.

561
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:27,855
- Looks exactly...
- [Doug laughs]

562
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:28,939
Ooh, look!

563
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,942
- Kenny?
- [Kenny] Yeah, bud?

564
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,028
- How did you find this boat?
- Cocktail, anyone?

565
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,988
- [Griff] Nice!
- [Doug] Ah!

566
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,073
[Kenny] It's a computer.

567
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,576
Yes!

568
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,790
[in Portuguese]
I want a list of all the boats

569
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,958
that left the marina in the last 3 hours.

570
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,127
Now!

571
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,421
[drawer opens]

572
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,051
[guitar playing]

573
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,095
- [all laughing]
- [glass clinking]

574
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,179
- [Griff] Uh-oh.
- [Claire] Oh.

575
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,390
[Doug] One more thing, you guys,
before we go to bed.

576
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,183
We got a big day tomorrow.

577
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:08,312
If you remember,
we had a tradition on all our films.

578
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,189
The night before we started shooting,

579
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,817
- we'd say a prayer to the movie gods...
- [Griff] Mm-hmm.

580
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,028
...asking them to basically
not screw us over,

581
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:19,323
and for the first time ever,
may they listen.

582
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,991
- Come on, to the movie gods.
- Yes.

583
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,076
[glasses clinking]

584
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,160
[Doug chuckles]

585
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,495
[all chattering indistinctly]

586
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,580
[epic music playing]

587
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,384
[Kenny] All right. We're rolling.

588
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,262
<i>Anaconda,</i> scene 15, take one. Slap it.

589
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,847
Bella!

590
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,101
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- I've come to take you home.

591
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,146
It's time you stopped chasing
this mythical snake.

592
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,190
And what if I'm not prone to giving up?

593
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:54,942
I didn't see you filming there.

594
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,819
What are we doing? EPK?

595
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,904
Background, DVD, bonus stuff.

596
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,741
<i>The Anaconda </i>is a story
of an intrepid biologist played by Claire,

597
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:08,372
<i>who hires an unhinged snake tracker</i>
<i>played by Griff,</i>

598
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,167
to hunt down and kill
a giant, mythical 'conda

599
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,501
that ate her entire family.

600
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,463
Come and get me, you goddamn snake!

601
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,715
And on a deeper level,
it's about chasing your dreams.

602
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:23,179
And camera set, push-ups good, and action!

603
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,597
What's it like shooting with Doug again?

604
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,182
He and I are best friends.

605
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,600
<i>We've worked together our whole lives.</i>

606
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,518
<i>And I went out to LA,</i>
<i>and he was gonna come out.</i>

607
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,271
We were gonna be a partnership,
and he didn't do it.

608
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,609
Griff and I planned to work together
in LA, but, uh, you know, life intervened.

609
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,277
But it doesn't matter,
'cause now we're together

610
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,405
and now we're back, we're making this,
and it's as it should be.

611
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,199
I am the insects.

612
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,158
[Claire shrieks]

613
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,911
The anaconda moves slow and steady.

614
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,078
Sometimes it goes fast.

615
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,706
Snake POV, RD. Take 1.

616
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,250
No. No, it's not working.

617
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,920
Snake POV, the right way. Take 2.

618
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:59,465
Sometimes he goes from above in the trees,

619
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,592
sometimes from below in the water.

620
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,804
The toothpick, it unlocked a couple
of aspects of this character for me.

621
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,014
There's something there.

622
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,643
Ah!

623
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,103
Why would I be nervous
about doing a love story with Griff?

624
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,355
You guys used to date.

625
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,232
That was a long time ago.

626
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,483
A little bit of chaos

627
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,193
<i>is part of the ingredients.</i>

628
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,111
[grunts, groans]

629
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,659
[shrieks]

630
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:27,910
[Doug] <i>Maybe look at each other.</i>

631
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,995
This might be the last time
you look at each other.

632
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,039
You'd think you'd be
a little nicer to the guy

633
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,916
who's out here to save your life.

634
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,251
You're an asshole.

635
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,835
[laughs]

636
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,462
Yeah.

637
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,131
And a PhD.

638
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,886
And cut.

639
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,847
- Great stuff, guys. We got it.
- Whoo-hoo!

640
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:51,767
Should we go one more time?
You wanna try it again?

641
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,435
No. I'm good if you're good.

642
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,853
Let's go one more time.

643
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,150
[animals chirping in distance]

644
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,236
[gentle music playing]

645
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,699
- The chemistry between you two is...
- Yeah?

646
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,993
- Like we were right back in high school.
- [chuckles]

647
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,411
When you looked up at her...

648
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,745
Well, that's 'cause of your note.

649
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,956
About taking the beat
right before you did it?

650
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,916
Yeah, yeah. It made the scene.

651
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,751
I tell you... [sighs]

652
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,588
[stutters] I never felt like this
on <i>S.W.A.T.</i>

653
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,881
I mean, granted
I was only in a couple of episodes,

654
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,925
but it was never collaborative.
It was never fun.

655
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,093
Not... [scoffs]

656
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,761
Not like this. This, uh...

657
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,347
- This is--
- Like we were back on <i>Quatch</i>?

658
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,892
Yeah. [chuckles]

659
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,769
Yeah.

660
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,777
[Doug] Do you guys have chupacabra?

661
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,864
[Claire] Ooh. That looks so good.

662
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:48,741
Mm-mmm.

663
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,368
Hey, so, one script thing.

664
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,912
I was thinking, at the midway point,

665
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,833
instead of, uh,
talking the bad guy out of it,

666
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,376
what if...

667
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,211
Claire's character...

668
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,631
headbutts him?

669
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,716
Sorry. Headbutts him?

670
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,426
Headbutts him.

671
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,511
Or... Or...

672
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:11,805
we both do.

673
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,307
- Double headbutt.
- [Claire scoffs]

674
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,559
- Come on. It's kinda revolutionary.
- [Kenny] Double headbutt.

675
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:17,061
That is super revolutionary.

676
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,104
Why is that super revolutionary?

677
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,273
Well, it's... [stutters]
...never been done.

678
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:24,652
Jesus Christ. This is a beautiful scene
with real stakes, Doug.

679
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,195
Feel free to weigh in here.

680
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,655
Nah, I hear you. I do.

681
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,324
And, as always,
I trust your instincts on this.

682
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,370
But a double headbutt
is pretty revolutionary.

683
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,373
Right? It is--
It's very revolutionary. Yes.

684
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,291
- There's no denying it.
- [Kenny] None!

685
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,419
Oh, come on, Claire. Is the problem that
you don't know how to headbutt?

686
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,797
Why would I not know how to headbutt?

687
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,049
[Griff] We're not born with these skills.
We learn them along the way.

688
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,469
Let me show you.
Tight core, breathe in, hold that breath.

689
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:51,845
- [Claire] Yeah?
- Hi-yah!

690
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,389
- [Griff] And you can vocalize.
- Wow.

691
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:58,644
Another kind of headbutt
is more unleashed, just full-on...

692
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,145
[exclaims] Whoo!

693
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,814
He got the arms in there. That's good.

694
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,440
Send that shit into the goal.

695
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:06,568
Or you put some Brazilian sauce on that.
You know?

696
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,737
- And you go, boom! <i>Toma</i>!
- [Doug] Oh!

697
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,197
- [Santiago] <i>Toma</i>!
- <i>Toma</i>?

698
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,407
Hey, I love it.

699
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,700
Yeah, that's right.

700
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,952
- Brazilian spice.
- Yeah!

701
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,996
If I was gonna headbutt,
I would go for the bridge of the nose.

702
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,207
- Yes.
- Just crack it. Hi-yah!

703
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,043
- Jesus!
- Yes! That's it.

704
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,464
- [Kenny] Jeez. Yeah, that's great.
- And you go, <i>"Toma! Toma!"</i>

705
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,382
[exclaims]

706
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,385

- I think it's a different... <i>Toma</i>!

707
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,178

I'm sorry, but how could this happen, huh?

718
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,029
Kenny, I thought you said
this guy was a pro.

719
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,532
That's what he said, but he hasn't
provided us with a certificate.

720
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,785
You fixed the crate, right?
It's taken care of?

721
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:41,538
My thing. My job. Under control. All good.

722
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:46,585
My Heitor, he's a beautiful, intelligent,
smart, sexy creature.

723
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,671
He does exactly what I command.

724
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:53,550
And I would never let anything happen

725
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:58,305
to you or the crazy one,
or her, or her, or this "actor" here.

726
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,766
- What the...
- So have a good night.

727
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:07,773
May the sounds of the forest
be the music of your dreams.

728

Jesus...

729
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,612
Man, he's a poet.

730
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,920
Okay. Actors, on your marks.

731
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,214
Santiago, is Heitor ready?

732
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,966
Yes, Heitor is always ready.

733
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,426
Heitor is ready, and action!

734
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,516
[whimpers] Cut, please.

735
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,895
- Um, cut? All right, cut. Yeah.
- Yeah, I just-- Sorry. I need a little...

736
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,355
Kenny, do you mind if I...

737
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,649
Santiago, take five. Heitor, five.

738
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,318
- Hey. Wow, that thing, it's really...
- Hey.

739
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:56,363
It's huge when you see it
up close and personal like that.

740
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,656
Majestic creature.

741
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,741
But I just was wondering...

742
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:04,496
I throw myself in front of the snake
to kind of protect Claire's character,

743
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,747
- right?
- Correct.

744
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,668
Is there any value in not doing that?

745
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,378
What? No.

746
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,423
- No, no, he sacrifices himself for her.
- Yeah. Of course.

747
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,800
- It caps his arc. It's so important.
- Right. Right.

748
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:20,012
- And also, dude, it's totally safe.
- Yeah.

749
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,848
- Santiago has Heitor under control.
- Okay.

750
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,018
- You've got nothing to worry about.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah...

751
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,061
- We're good. You're good.
- Yeah. Okay.

752
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,855
- Okay.
- All right, let's do this.

753
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,315
All right, take it from the top.

754
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,109
Back to one.

755
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:38,405
Santiago, Heitor? Action!

756
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,490
Go!

757
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,411
I'm not leaving! Not without you, Derek.

758
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,539
This thing's got me.
The world's depending on you.

759
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,583
I'm depending on you.

760
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,336
Goddamn it! I love you, Derek van Hoyle!

761
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:55,255
It's just-- I can't-- [groans]

762
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,383
- Put your face right up next to the snake.
- I don't like this.

763
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,719
- I don't want to do it anymore.
- [Doug] Get a tiny bit closer.

764
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,554
Get closer. He's friendly.

765
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:05,390
- I think you got it, dude!
- No, I don't quite have it!

766
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,935
- Doug, you got the shot! You got the shot!
- Hold it! Just a couple more beats.

767
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,270
This is gold.
Just give me one more second.

768
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:12,481
One inch closer to your face.

769
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,900
- Get it right up in there!

over some dead snake.

Hey. I don't want you here. Not for this!

Well, the producers decided that
they didn't really need that character,

833
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,455
so they got rid of me.

00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:37,264
Listen.

855
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,724
There are snakes around here.

856
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,351
I can feel it.

857
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,770
[Griff] What does it feel like?

858
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,649
I don't know. It's just very snaky.

859
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,609
What's-- It's snaky?

860
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,114
Ah.

861
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,453
They hear from vibrations on the ground.

862
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,958
Every step we take,

863
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,919
drawing them closer.

864
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,631
And when the jungle goes quiet...

865
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,178
that's when you know they're close.

866
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,062
[Santiago] Yeah.

867
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,948
Hey, maybe we should
go back to the boat, huh?

868
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:39,492
Think it'd be a good idea to go back
to the boat. Let's go back to the boat.

869
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,454
[whispering] Santiago.

870
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,289
Santiago.

871
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:46,791
[shouting] Santiago!

872
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,337
[animal squawking]

873
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,005
Nope.

874
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,758
[gasping, panting]

875
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,488
Where are you?

876
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:22,160
[screaming]

877
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,925
Hey. Have you seen Santiago?
I don't think he's come back.

878
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:41,012
- Back? From what?
- We went out to go get a new snake. We--

879
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,598
You went to find a snake
in the middle of the night?

880
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,934
Yeah, we need one for the movie.
It was dark. We got separated.

881
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,102
It was crazy out there.

882
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,603
- Griff, Griff, Griff, Griff.
- What?

883
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,773
You went out in the middle of the night
to find a juicy snake in the jungle?

884
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,483
You know what that's called?

885
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:55,527
Producing.

886
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:59,030
- Really?
- I guarantee he will be back

887
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:03,868
with a giant snake,
and you and I are making movies.

888
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:06,454
You're right. Santiago's a pro.
He'll be fine.

889
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,832
If he's not back soon,
we'll go look for him.

890
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,960
[stereo playing Brazilian music]

891
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,549
[music stops]

892
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,357
Thank you very much, Santiago.

893
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:40,155
Guys, it's been over an hour.
I have to go find him.

894
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,823
Well, you're not going alone.

895
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,075
Yeah, we're definitely coming with you.
It's safer that way.

896
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,411
[Kenny chuckles]
Have you guys tried this thing?

897
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:52,667
It's like a warm bowl of soup
but... [laughs] ...but in chair form.

898
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,752
[Kenny] Yeah, man. Chairs.

899
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,172
They, like, hold you, man.

900
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,258
They literally have arms, right?

901
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,720
[chuckles] Oh, wow.

902
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,139
Like when your parents are gone...

903
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,102
we still have chairs, you know?

904
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:15,231
What the hell are you talking about?

905
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:17,150
Let's go find Santiago.

906
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,110
Let's get a snake for our snake movie.

907
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:21,237
Yeah, Santiago! Let's go!

908
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:22,572
[animals chittering]

909
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,574
[tense music playing]

910
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,081
[whispering] Hey, what direction
are we headed in?

911
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:33,791
Um...

912
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:35,710
Like, that way.

913
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,796
Wait. Kenny, are you high right now?

914
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,924
Yeah, but I'm good. I already peaked.

915
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,300
Jesus Christ, Kenny.

916
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,885
We're completely lost.

917
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,806
Wait. You guys, this way.

918
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,184
It looks like an old camper van.

919
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,687
[tense music playing]

920
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,033
[sighs]

921
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,660
[walkie-talkie bleeps]

922
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,203
[in Portuguese] Ana is not on the boat.

923
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,748
I need you to search the area.

924
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,167
The men are scared to
go deeper into the jungle.

925
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:18,545
<i>I don't care, we have to find her.</i>

926
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:24,634
[Griff] What is that?

927
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,470
[Kenny chuckles] Oh,
maybe Santiago's sleeping in there.

928
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:28,513
[Doug] <i>Hola.</i>

929
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,931
[animals chittering]

930
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:32,267
[Doug] Whoa.

931
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,271
Looks totally abandoned. Anybody home?

932
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,189
[Claire sighs]

933
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:43,945
Maybe some food and water.

934
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,405
Yeah. We could stay here.

935
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:46,614
At least tonight.

936
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:55,123
Oh, man, there's gotta be snacks in here.

937
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:57,458
[rustling nearby]

938
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:58,960
[shushes]

939
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:04,716
[rustling]

940
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,801
[tense music playing]

941
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,056
[Ana breathes shakily]

942
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,231
[all breathing shakily]

943
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:23,985
[all scream]

944
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,236
Oh, my God.

945
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,362
- [Kenny] Oh, God.
- [Doug] Santiago!

946
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:27,614
[Claire] Oh, God.

947
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,324
- [Doug gasps]
- [Kenny] Dang!

948
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:31,909
That's where that guy went!

949
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,828
Oh, my God. What is out there?

950
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,830
[tense music playing]

951
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,914
[growling]

952
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:44,839
[Claire breathes shakily]

953
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,799
- [Ana] We gotta go now!
- Okay. Go, go, go.

954
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,718
- Let's get out of here.
- [Ana] Let's go, let's go.

955
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,887
- We can't let it crush the van.
- Crush the van?

956
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:51,888
- It's not working.
- [engine sputtering]

957
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:52,805
What?

958
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:53,723
- It's not--
- Damn it!

959
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,475
- It's a camper van, probably!
- Oh, God!

960
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,685
It's got a split-- [stutters]
a split-charge battery.

961
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,146
The relay probably popped off.
It's underneath the hood.

962
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,564
Kenny, can you fix it?

963
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,941
Usually I could fix it, yes,
but I'm having--

964
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,153
I'm still having some visual problems
because of the... [chuckles]

965
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,655
You did it to me again.

966
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:13,368
You did it on the wedding video
and now you're wasted off your ass again.

967
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,869
I'm really sorry, boss.

968
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,665
[groans] Buffalo sober.
You're Buffalo sober.

969
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:19,749
Do you have any more?

970
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,959
Griff, please can you fix it?

971
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,961
I think I'm better suited
to be our wheel man.

972
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,089
What are you talking about?
I've always been a better driver than you.

973
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,131
No, you've been a safer driver.

974
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:29,300
I passed the driver's test
on my first try.

975
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,718
You took three times.

976
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,220
Yeah, but that was 'cause of yield.

977
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,013
I didn't know-- Now I know what that is.

978
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,307
Oh, my God. We're gonna die.

979
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:37,642
[breathes heavily]

980
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,519
Sorry.

981
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,313
I'll just fix it.

982
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,399
[tense music playing]

983
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,664
[breathes shakily]

00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,225
[creaks]

[hood thuds, clatters]

00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:53,801
[Claire breathes shakily]

991

- [engine starts]

00:50:58,139 --> 00:50:58,973
[screams]

993
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,433
- Doug!
- Go, go, go!

994
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,810
Let me get up. Hey, wait! Stop! Stop!

995
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,646
Griff, where are you going?
Don't leave without me!

996
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,731
[grunts]

997
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,984
Oh, shit!

998
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,737
[groans, cries]

999
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,946
[Griff] You saw it, right?

1000
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,698
What was that? They're not
supposed to get that big.

1001
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:18,534
Oh, God. It was like a dinosaur. [screams]

1002
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,163
[engines revving]

1003
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:23,915
Hey!

1004
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,628
Hey, maybe we can ask these guys for help.

1005
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:29,545
- Hey!
- Hey!

1006
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,881
- We have to stop.
- Do not stop the car.

1007
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,257
Ana, what is going on?

1008
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:36,219
They're illegal gold miners
who patrol the jungles around here.

1009
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,678
These guys are dangerous.

1010
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,598
They'll kill anyone
who crosses into their territory.

1011
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,892
- Oh, shit. They're trying to kill us.
- [Griff] Fuck!

1012
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,228
[Doug] Why are they shooting at us?

1013
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,979
- [gunshot]
- [Griff exclaims]

1014
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:48,731
[Claire] Griff,
can't you drive any faster?

1015
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:51,567
Whoa!

1016
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:53,402
Whoa, whoa. Ana, what are you doing?

1017
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:54,320
[Ana grunts]

1018
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,446
Whoa!

1019
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,823
[Ana grunting]

1020
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,909
- [Doug] Kenny, are you getting this?
- [Kenny] Yes!

1021
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:02,578
Keep rolling!

1022
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:05,623
[Ana groans]

1023
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,959
Griff, faster.

1024
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,336
[exclaims]

1025
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,547
Only one left.

1026
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,298
[groaning]

1027
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,342

00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,155
- Where is she?
- [gasps] Oh, my God.

1031
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,282
Where is she?

1032
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,203
Who? Who do... Who do you mean?

1033
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:45,788
I know there's someone else here.

1034
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,999
So, where is she--

1035
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,125
[Ana exclaims]

1036
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:54,463
Let's go, come on.

1037
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:56,090
We gotta go. Fast.

1038
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,092
[Claire breathing heavily]

1039
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,094
Look, I can get you guys out of here.

1040
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,305
All we need to do is keep heading north.

1041
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:06,017
There's a small airport
about a day and a half from here.

1042
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,810
You can get us home?

1043
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,520
- [Ana] Yes.
- Get us home.

1044
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:10,897
I think we gotta call it.

1045
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,233
Man, we've got such good stuff,
and we're so close.

1046
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:17,778
Really? We're going home?

1047
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:18,863
[Doug] Buddy, I know.

1048
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,449
I don't wanna go home empty-handed either.

1049
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,243
But we came out here to make <i>Anaconda</i>,

1050
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:25,953
and now we're in it.

1051
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:27,496
[mumbles]

1052
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:29,415
[tapping on table]

1053
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,541
Yeah.

1054
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:35,463
I'm sorry.

1055
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,303
[sighs]

1056
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:48,643
[kisses]

1057
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:50,519
[exhales deeply]

1058
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:52,605
[epic music playing]

1059
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:13,876
[exhales deeply]

1060
00:54:14,669 --> 00:54:17,838
Guys, emergency meeting.

1061
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,840
Cast and crew only. Kenny, sit down.

1062
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,676
- [Kenny] What is that?
- New pages.

1063
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,469
We have some time before the next port

1064
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:27,848
and I had an idea last night that I think
is just too damn good not to shoot.

1065
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,643
Doug, everybody's pretty burnt, man.

1066
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,895
Just hear me out.
I'm begging you please, Kenny.

1067
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:34,981
- All right. Sorry, boss.
- [Doug] Thank you.

1068
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,942
What if you two, on your way
to find the anaconda,

1069
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,070
ran into a total badass
on an incredible quest?

1070
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,322
Oh. That's interesting.

1071
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:46,826
Let me guess,
to expose illegal gold miners?

1072
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:47,743
Bingo.

1073
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:49,870
- Raises the stakes.
- [Doug] Exactly.

1074
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,872
And while they're hunting down
this mythical snake,

1075
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,041
they actually end up
fighting the real villain.

1076
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,626
An even bigger snake.

1077
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,170
- Man.
- Oh, yeah. Yes.

1078
00:54:58,254 --> 00:54:59,463
Man.

1079
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:00,965
I like this.

1080
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,508
This is good.

1081
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,761
And if we add this element,
it does make the movie much bigger.

1082
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:08,723
Like, now, it's about something.

1083
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,767
Themes.

1084
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,311
Themes. [chuckles]

1085
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,355
Uh...

1086
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:20,860
Uh-huh.

1087
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,153
Yeah.

1088
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,030
Okay, guy-- You know what, guys?

1089
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:26,699
[stammering] I didn't wanna say
anything before, but...

1090
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:30,578
this thing might be an Awards play.

1091
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,329
[Claire gasps]

1092
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:35,291
I mean, the Academy loves social horror.

1093
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,459
- Right?
- [Griff] Yeah.

1094
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:41,505
Dude, you could be the white Jordan Peele.

1095
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:44,258
[sighs] I was thinking the same thing.

1096
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:49,305
We've been through so much, you guys.

1097
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,640
Let's finish this movie.

1098
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,269
I'm in.

1099
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,520
- Let's do it.
- [Griff] Yeah.

1100
00:55:56,604 --> 00:56:01,984
Oh... Who are you gonna get to play
this new, awesome character?

1101
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,821
[exclaims in Portuguese]

1102
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,531
[Kenny] Ow! [groaning]

1103
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:09,158
[speaking Portuguese]

1104
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,202
And cut. Yes!

1105
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,745
- [Ana] Was it good?
- That's what I'm talking about.

1106
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:13,662
- [Claire] Nice.
- [Kenny] Yeah.

1107
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:16,040
- You sure you've never acted before?
- I swear.

1108
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,917
Some of the best acting I've ever seen.

1109
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,045
- You're a natural. You're incredible.
- [Ana] Thank you.

1110
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,797
Take five. Next up, we got 72.

1111
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:27,009
- Guys, you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

1112
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,677
- She's incredible, right?
- Yeah.

1113
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,846
Hey... [stammers] ...a question, though.

1114
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:35,142
If-- If she saves us, it doesn't really
give my character anything to do.

1115
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:36,268
Yeah.

1116
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:40,397
This was supposed to be the moment where
my character starts falling for Derek,

1117
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:44,401
so he needs to do
something heroic, you know? Unselfish.

1118
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:47,029
I don't know, you guys,
this just feels like her moment,

1119
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,198
she actually did it in real life.

1120
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,284
But good news, I'm gonna shoot
all the rest on her

1121
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:54,120
so you guys have the day off.

1122
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,038
See you later.

1123
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:58,624
Take the day off.

1124
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,210
Huh.

1125
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,254
[gentle music playing]

1126
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:10,678
[Claire] This is our movie, Griff,
and he's just cutting us out.

1127
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,596
[Griff] Yep.
Welcome to show business, baby.

1128
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,891
You're not in it unless you're getting
screwed over by your friends.

1129
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:16,976
[chuckles]

1130
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:18,561
Yeah.

1131
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:24,108
You ever wake up and wonder
what the hell have I done with my life?

1132
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:27,486
- [chuckling] Oh, yeah. Like, every day.
- Mmm.

1133
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,072
Hey, at least you had the guts
to go after what you wanted.

1134
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:32,032
- No.
- You think I wanted to go to law school?

1135
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,326
What have I got to show
for it though, huh?

1136
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,411
You know what I have?

1137
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:39,373
I have a terrible apartment
and a 74-year-old roommate.

1138
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:44,461
[sighs] Sometimes I go to Trader Joe's
just to feel air conditioning.

1139
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,548
You at least have a career.

1140
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:51,051
I mean, what do I have to show for it?

1141
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:55,264
I've got no family. No career.

1142
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:58,017
Never done anything that matters.

1143
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,560
No nothing.

1144
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,270
[sighs]

1145
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,189
It's never too late.

1146
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,406
[knocking on door]

1147
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,074
[Doug] <i>Griff, I know you're in there.</i>

1148
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,451
<i>Let's make a movie.</i>

1149
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:17,995
[Griff groans]

1150
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:19,872
Ugh.

1151
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:20,956
<i>Hola, amigo.</i>

1152
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,876
Jesus. Come on, get dressed.
We've got a packed day.

1153
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,461
What are you talking about?
I am dressed.

1154
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,588
I'm dressed really...
very nicely.

1155
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,548
All right. Can you just
take a cold shower?

1156
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:30,966
We gotta film, like, now.

1157
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,052
Here's an idea. You know what
you should call the movie?

1158
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,596
<i>Ana-conda. </i>Get it?

1159
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,973
<i>Ana-conda</i>, 'cause of Ana.

1160
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,975
Can you just get in costume?

1161
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:41,310
Man, you know what?
You wouldn't even be here

1162
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,519
if it wasn't for me.

1163
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,772
Without me, you'd still
be stuck in Buffalo

1164
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,149
shooting your bullshit
wedding videos.

1165
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:49,026
[breathes heavily] Films.

1166
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,945
Yeah, you can
tell yourself that.

1167
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,822
My God, you know what?
I-- I-- I vouched for you too.

1168
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:54,865
Even the rights holders,

1169
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,116
they're like,
"Who is this guy?"

1170
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,785
I said, "Trust me. He's good."

1171
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,662
[boat approaching]

1172
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:00,746
What is that?

1173
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,126
[announcer]
<i>Attention, all crew.</i>

1174
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,546
<i>Let's get prepped</i>
<i>for scene 85, location Bravo.</i>

1175
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,965
<i>Five minutes.</i>

1176
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,383
[Claire]
Are they making a movie?

1177
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,134
[announcer]
<i>Five minutes to arrival.</i>

1178
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:17,429
Excuse me,
are you guys shooting a movie?

1179
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,640
We're doing a reboot
of <i>Anaconda.</i>

1180
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,433
[Doug] Come again?

1181
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:23,435
[crew member]
A reboot of <i>Anaconda.</i>

1182
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,728
<i>Anaconda</i>?

1183
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,398
- Like, Ice Cube <i>Anaconda</i>?
- Yeah.

1184
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,108
Sony is rebooting it.

1185
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,069
I know. No new ideas.

1186
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,780
[tense music playing]

1187
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:47,501
That's weird.

1188
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,005
So, let me get this straight.

1189
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,174
You don't have the rights
to <i>Anaconda</i>?

1190
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:56,385
No, well, I...

1191
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,887
Not legally.

1192
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,599
And you've never owned
the rights to <i>Anaconda</i>?

1193
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,062
I mean, who owns <i>Anaconda</i>?

1194
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:09,940
Sony. Sony owns <i>Anaconda.</i>

1195
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:11,191
Yeah, no, no, I know. I know.

1196
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:14,194
I mean, like, you know, like,
in the larger sense.

1197
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:16,655
Why would you tell us
that you had the rights

1198
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:19,241
to the goddamn
<i>Anaconda </i>franchise

1199
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:21,660
when you very much
don't have the rights

1200
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:24,121
to the goddamn
<i>Anaconda </i>franchise?

1201
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,957
Do we... [stammers] ...really
even need the rights?

1202
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,584
Really? I mean, like,
who gives a shit?

1203
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,171
- About IP?
- Yeah.

1204
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,423
Literally everyone. [chuckles]

1205
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:37,468
That's what big movies are!
That's why we're here!

1206
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,719
You think that's
why we're here?

1207
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,095
Yes, that's why we're here!

1208
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,555
We almost died!

1209
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,517
We're out in the middle of
the goddamn jungle for a lie!

1210
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:47,144
I had to lie!

1211
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:48,896
I had to lie to you!

1212
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,105
You wouldn't have
come otherwise!

1213
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:52,024
You wouldn't...
None of you would have--

1214
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,777
- [groans] Bullshit!
- [Griff] Not bullshit.

1215
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,112
It's why you never came out to
LA with me in the first place,

1216
01:00:57,196 --> 01:01:00,157
even though we had
a whole plan to work together.

1217
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,243
Your whole life, you've just--
it's been dictated by fear.

1218
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,121
Griff,

1219
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:08,791
you're fired.

1220
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,168
- What?
- [Doug] You're fired.

1221
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:15,297
No. No, I'm not.

1222
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:17,091
You can't fire me.
You know why?

1223
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,635
Because I quit already.

1224
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:21,470
Last night.

1225
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,350
I just didn't tell
anybody yet.

1226
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:28,477
So...

1227
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,607
Too bad for you, I guess,
because I already quit.

1228
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,692
[tense music playing]

1229
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:49,998
Griff, wait!

1230
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,668
Where are you even gonna go?

1231
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,169
To find the <i>Anaconda </i>boat.

1232
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:55,587
Maybe they can help me
get home.

1233
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:57,923
Just think about this.
It's not safe.

1234
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,383
That's a tiny boat.

1235
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,343
There's a giant snake
out there.

1236
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,681
Please don't do this.

1237
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:09,852
Griff.

1238
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,567
[epic music playing]

1239
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,006
[music fades]

1240
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:53,520
J.Lo?

1241
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,189
Ice Cube?

1242
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,776
Jon Voight?
Are you in this one?

1243
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:00,903
[crew member screaming]
Help me!

1244
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,279
Help me, man! Help me!

1245
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,614
- Hey!
- Help me!

1246
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,824
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Help! Help me!

1247
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:07,493
- Calm down. I'll come get you.
- Oh, my...

1248
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,536
It's okay. You're safe.

1249
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,954
- You're safe.
- Oh, thank God.

1250
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,874
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

1251
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,627
- [yelps]
- [engine revving]

1252
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:20,214
Oh, God!

1253
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:25,052
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1254
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,097
- [Claire] Doug!
- Mm-hmm?

1255
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:31,308
Doug, what's going on?
Why have we stopped?

1256
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:35,270
Well, Ana found a great place
to shoot the next scene.

1257
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:36,647
- To shoot?
- The next scene? What?

1258
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,316
Look. Look, okay, I know.
Losing Griff was hard,

1259
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,818
but between the four of us,
we can finish this film.

1260
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,195
I'm not going home
empty-handed.

1261
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:45,489
Come on, man. Without Griff...

1262
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,115
That's not part of the plan.

1263
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,035
Well, plans change and that's
part of filmmaking too.

1264
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:52,120
No, no, Doug,
we have to go back for him.

1265
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:53,539
- He's not safe out there.
- Yeah.

1266
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:55,290
Ana. We need to turn
the boat around.

1267
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:57,125
We are not turning
the boat around.

1268
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,961
Yeah, we're not turning
the boat around.

1269
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,380
Everyone off the boat now.

1270
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,297
What's going on?

1271
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,966
[tense music playing]

1272
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,134
Ana, what are you doing?

1273
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:07,886
This definitely isn't the plan.

1274
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,846
Well, plans change, Doug.

1275
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,431
Isn't that filmmaking?

1276
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,349
[gun cocks]

1277
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,560
And every good film needs
a bit of a twist.

1278
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:18,021
Everyone off the boat now!

1279
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:22,568
[tense music playing]

1280
01:05:01,023 --> 01:05:02,149
Oh...

1281
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:11,366
[Ana] To the dock.

1282
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,307
[Kenny strains, grunts]

1283
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,145
You're gonna carry these for
me back to the boat. Let's go.

1284
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:41,271
And then what?

1285
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:43,523
And then you're gonna
shoot us?

1286
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,650
Now!

1287
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,235
I'm not going anywhere

1288
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,529
until you tell me
what's inside these bags.

1289
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,990
You wanna look at it?
Look at it.

1290
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:55,702
Huh.

1291
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:01,958
[Claire] Wait. Is...
Is that...

1292
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,419
Gold?

1293
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:07,381
So you're the miner?
You did all of this for money?

1294
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,548
Very quick, Claire.

1295
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,009
- [Doug exclaims]
- No!

1296
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:14,429
I'm not gonna be part
of your sick quest for--

1297
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:15,347
[Kenny] Ooh! Holy shit.

1298
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,264
[in Portuguese] Drop it.

1299
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:17,933
Drop the gun.

1300
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:19,768
The gun.

1301
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:22,354
Now!

1302
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,647
Calm down.

1303
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,027
[in English] And you, don't move!

1304
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,571
[panting]

1305
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:34,574
I'm with the government.

1306
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,618
We track illegal gold miners.

1307
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:37,786
And Ana here runs one

1308
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,413
of the biggest rings
in Brazil.

1309
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:40,622
[Ana speaking Portuguese]

1310
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,541
This gold can change your life.

1311
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,418
You think I care about gold?

1312
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:45,669
Don't trust anything she says.

1313
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,796
She's a liar.
She's a damn liar.

1314
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,506
We're filmmakers from Buffalo.

1315
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:52,008
We're working on
a spiritual sequel to <i>Anaconda</i>

1316
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:53,385
and I don't know
if she mentioned that,

1317
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:54,720
but it's not just a reboot,

1318
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,596
and I kicked out my friend
who had the lead,

1319
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,890
and I gave her
a juicy-ass role,

1320
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,142
- and this is how she treats--
- [Kenny] Really juicy!

1321
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,853
Shut up! I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

1322
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,896
Off-topic. Go, arrest her.

1323
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,064
Oh, thank God.

1324

- [gasps]
- Oh, my God!

1328
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,374
Who shot me?

1329
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:27,294
That'd be me, asshole.

1330
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,963
Griff, no. He was a good guy.

1331
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,923
- I'm a good guy.
- He's a cop.

1332
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:33,049
Look, I don't-- What?

1333
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:36,052
I'm a good guy.

1334
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,471
Drop it. On your knees now,
the four of you,

1335
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,680
facing the water.

1336
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:41,975
- [Kenny] Wait. I--
- Now.

1340
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:58,909
No, no, Ana.
Don't-- Don't do this.

1341
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,702
[Ana] You too, Claire.
On your knees, now.

1342
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,454
You don't have
to be this person.

1343
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:07,000
I have children at home.
They're 10 and 13.

1344
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:08,502
Please.

1345
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:10,253
Please.

1346
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:12,255
Think about what
you're doing to my kids.

1347
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:14,341
Just shut your mouth.
Turn around now.

1348
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:16,927

how you headbutt, bitch!

[Ana breathes heavily]

1358
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,492
You won't do it.

1359

You don't have the balls.
I know you, Claire.

1360

You don't know me.

1361
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:45,580

I think the boat
is back that way!

1370
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:07,310
Yeah, but so is the snake.
We can't go that way!

1371
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:09,813
We gotta take this trail
and get to the high ground.

01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,065
- [Doug] Wait. What's that?
- [Claire, Kenny] What?

1373
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,567
- [Griff] What?
- [screams]

1374
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,651
Oh, shit!

1375
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,570
- [whimpering]
- [Claire] Oh, my God.

1376
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,529
Did it bite you?

1377
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:18,738
Yeah, you know what,
I think it bit me.

1378
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,699
- I think it got me.
- Dougie, I know it hurts,

1379
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,200
but we gotta get out
of here now

1380
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:23,785
because the snake
is out there!

1381
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:26,830
I'm sorry, I can't move.
My leg is freaking out.

1382
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,665
[cries] What are we gonna do?

1383
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,750
We're gonna have to piss
on you, man.

1384
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:32,752
- Huh?
- On the bite.

1385
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,045
It's the only way.

1386
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:35,589
I thought that
was just jellyfish.

1387
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,258
No, no, no, no.
It's all animals.

1388
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,801
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1389
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:41,928
Someone's gotta piss.
I need one of your pisses.

1390
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,055
I'd love to be able
to help out, but I'm just--

1391
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:47,267
I am drained,
tapped, bone-dry.

1392
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,935
Claire, you wanna
take care of this?

1393
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:50,437
I'm wearing a onesie.

1394
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,981
Kenny, we don't have time
to argue about this. You're up.

1395
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,774
You know this isn't possible.

1396
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,443
Why not?

1397
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:57,777
Because he's...

1398
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,821
Pee shy.

1399
01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:00,739
Pee shy?

1400
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:02,032
[Kenny] I have urinary
stage fright.

1401
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,951
I haven't been able
to pee in public in 35 years.

1402
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,620
My life sucks!

1403
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:07,704
You can do this.

1404
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,289
You have to do this.

1405
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,291
Whiz on me.

1406
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,043
- [Griff] You got it, buddy.
- Okay.

1407
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,962
- [Griff] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1408
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,255
- You can do it.
- [Griff] You can do it.

1409
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:19,716
- Let it flow.
- Let it flow. Yeah.

1410
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,052
Just piss on me. Come on.
Whiz on me.

1411
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,887
Whiz on me. Do it. Whiz on me.

1412
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,556
You...
You don't think I want to?

1413
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,768
I would love to piss
all over you, man.

1414
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:32,020
But it's not in the cards!

1415
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,314
- Whiz on me. Now.
- I can't. I'm trying.

1416
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,025
- You can do it! Whiz on me!
- I'm trying my hardest!

1417
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:38,985
Do it, Ken! Do it, Ken.
Do it. Do it.

1418
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,862
That is an order!
Whiz on me now!

1419
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:43,198
Okay! Okay.

1420
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,283
[Griff] You got it, buddy.
You do it.

1421
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,328
- There's one more problem.
- What?

1422
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,330
I haven't told you about this.

1423
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,123
I can only pee sitting down.

1424
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:53,667
Jesus Christ!

1425
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,251
I need a chair.

1426
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:59,130
Come on, come on, come on.

1427
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,299
Come on, buddy.

1428
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:02,968
Come on, Kenny.
Come on, come on.

1429
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,219
Just do it. Do it!

1430
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:05,845
- Come on, buddy.
- [Kenny] Do it.

1431
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,055
Come on, buddy.

1432
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,682
[suspenseful music playing]

1433
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:13,937
[urine trickling]

1434
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,314
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1435
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:18,858
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- [Griff] Nice!

1436
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:22,028
- Yes! Yeah!
- [Doug] Yeah! Yeah!

1437
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:23,488
[no audible dialogue]

1438
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,198
[triumphant music playing]

1439
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:35,834
Yeah!

1440
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,512
[animals chittering]

1441
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,810
[Doug breathing heavily]

1442
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,770
[Doug whispering]
Griff, I'm sorry about

1443
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:58,106
what I said before
on the boat.

1444
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,151
The truth is,

1445
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,112
I've been jealous of you
for a long, long time.

1446
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:05,488
Jealous?

1447
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:07,782
For having the balls
to do what I couldn't.

1448
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:09,242
For going after
what you wanted.

1449
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,411
Going to LA
and putting yourself on the--

1450
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:13,913
[muffled grunting]

1451
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,331
Oh, my God!

1452
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,083
- [Kenny] Oh, shit!
- Doug!

1453
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:18,376
[Kenny] Oh, my God!

1454
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,170
[Claire gasping]

1455
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,172
We have--
We have to go after him!

1456
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:23,715
[Kenny]
We gotta get out of here.

1457
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:24,924
We do not have a choice.
Come on.

1458
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,351
[Claire panting]

1459
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:36,936
Griff.

1460
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,315
Oh, Griff.

1461
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,901
[breathing heavily] Oh.

1462
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:44,527
What did I do?

1463
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,238
I tricked him
into coming here,

1464
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:48,490
and now he's dead.

1465
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:52,077
No. No.
We all chose to be here.

1466
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,369
I wish it was me.

1467
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,413
It should be me.

1468
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:57,999
This is not your fault,
and we have to keep going.

1469
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:02,295
Hey, guys, I think I found out
which way we should go.

1470
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:06,007
[suspenseful music playing]

1471
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:17,560
Hey.

1472
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,938
[panting]

1473
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:21,523
It's a...

1474
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,024
It's a big open field.

1475
01:13:23,108 --> 01:13:25,401
We gotta get across it
to get to the boat.

1476
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:26,861
But we can't just run across.

1477
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:28,154
It's too exposed.

1478
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:30,323
The snake could come
from anywhere.

1479
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,660
Maybe we can create
a distraction.

1480
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:37,997
Yeah, yeah, maybe, but,
I mean, how do we do that?

1481
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,374
[breathes heavily]

1482
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:41,334
- I mean, it's gonna be... What?
- [shushes]

1483
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,045
[leaves rustling]

1484
01:13:50,135 --> 01:13:51,678
[growling]

1485
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:56,891
It's here.

1486
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,418
[gasps]

1487
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:25,712
[flies buzzing]

1488
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,796
What?

1489
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:28,673
What?

1490
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,759
Oh, my God. Doug. Doug, no.

1491
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,804
Oh, Dougie. Dougie.

1492
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:37,098
- Come on, man.
- [Claire] Is he...

1493
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,310
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- [shushes]

1494
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:42,729
[Claire crying]

1495
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,649
Wait. Wait.

1496
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:52,864
Maybe Doug is the distraction.

1497
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:55,992
[sobs] How?

1498
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,161
I know this is horrible, okay?

1499
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,497
But if we can drag Doug out
into the field,

1500
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:02,957
prop him up

1501
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,586
and attach the boar
to his back

1502
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,297
wouldn't we make it
really hard

1503
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,882
for the snake to swallow him?

1504
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,635
It'll occupy the snake
long enough

1505
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,511
for us to get across the field

1506
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:16,763
and get back to the boat.

1507
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:19,724
Mmm, it's a really smart idea.

1508
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,769
[Kenny straining]

1509
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:26,022
Oh, guys, this is horrible.

1510
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,232
If it meant saving all of us,

1511
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:28,608
I'm sure Doug
would've wanted this.

1512
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,568
I'm not sure
he would've wanted this.

1513
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:31,527
Wait.

1514
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:32,612
We gotta go, guys.

1515
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,364
[Claire] What are you gonna do?
What are you doing?

1516
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,032
[stammers, sighs]

1517
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,159
Snakes,
they love squirrel meat.

1518
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:39,244
[Claire groans]

1519
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:41,996
[Kenny grunting]

1520
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,165
[kisses]

1521
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,464
[suspenseful music playing]

1522
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:54,884
[all panting]

1523
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,553
Wait, the snake
is right behind him.

1524
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:02,517
[ethereal music playing]

1525
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,602
[growling]

1526
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,941
Oh.

1527
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:14,320
I can't... [stammers]

1528
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:23,496
[grunts]

1529
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,789
Oh, shit!

1530
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:26,124
[muffled grunting]

1531
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,045
- He's alive! He's alive!
- He's alive!

1532
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:33,047
- Thought you checked his pulse!
- I did!

1533
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,133
[Griff]
Well, you did a shitty job!

1534
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:36,384
What the fuck?

1535
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,302
[playful music playing]

1536
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:39,846
- [Kenny] Doug! Watch out! Run!
- [Griff] Doug! Run!

1537
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,639
Come on, Doug, run!

1538
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:44,309
- [Kenny] Hey!
- [Griff] Run! Faster!

1539
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:45,476
Hey.

1540
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,478
- Doug, run!
- Doug!

1541
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:48,354
What?

1542
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,398
- He's right behind you!
- What?

1543
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,942
- [Griff] Run, Doug!
- [Kenny] Doug!

1544
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:54,027
