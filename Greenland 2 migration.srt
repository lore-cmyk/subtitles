Yeah, I believe it's possible.

708

So it is just like
the dinosaurs, the K-T event.

709
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,511
Nathan, do you know what
happened after the K-T event?

710
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:13,945
Life came back.

711
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:14,846
Not just came back.

712
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,381
It flourished.

713
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:21,753

the seeds for new life.
